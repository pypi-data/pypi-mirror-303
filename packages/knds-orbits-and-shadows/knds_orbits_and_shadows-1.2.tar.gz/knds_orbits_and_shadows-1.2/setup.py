    LONG_DESCRIPTION = fh.read() 

###'This is a package for Python 3.10, loaded with Opencv 4.10 and Imageio 2.36, to compute and draw (animated) shadows of a KNdS black hole (i.e. a charged rotating black hole inside a cosmological universe), possibly equipped with a thin Keplerian accretion disk, radiating as a blackbody. This code also allows to draw (massive or null) orbits in a KNdS space-time, using different integration methods of the geodesic equation.'
