class Analysis(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for defining a finite element analysis (FEA).

    The :class:`Analysis` class serves as a foundational blueprint for creating specific
    types of FEA models. It is designed to project the generic 3D behavior of objects
    from the :class:`Member1D` and :class:`Node` classes into specific model behaviors
    suitable for various types of analysis.

    This class defines a set of abstract methods that must be implemented in its subclasses.
    These implementations should provide the specific properties and behaviors unique to each
    type of FEA model. The abstract nature of this class means it cannot be instantiated
    directly; instead, it should be subclassed to create specific model types such as:

      - :class:`FrameXZAnalysis`
      - :class:`FrameXYZAnalysis`
      - :class:`GridXYAnalysis`
      - :class:`TrussXYAnalysis`
      - :class:`TrussXYZAnalysis`

    Each subclass represents a different structural analysis model, encapsulating the unique
    characteristics and behaviors of that model type.

    :param analysis_type: The type of FEA model to be used, which dictates the behavior
                          of the analysis model.
    :param active_dofs: A list of active degrees of freedom for the model. These represent
                        the translational and rotational DoFs that are considered in the analysis.
    :param active_rotational_dofs: A subset of ``active_dofs`` specifying which DoFs are rotational.
    :ivar active_displacement_dofs: A subset of ``active_dofs`` specifying which DoFs are translational.
    :ivar n_dof_per_node: The number of active degrees of freedom per node.
    :ivar n_rot_dof_per_node: The number of active rotational degrees of freedom per node.
    :ivar dof_elem_axial, dof_elem_flexural_xy, dof_elem_flexural_xz, dof_elem_torsion: Lists
      that will be populated with indices corresponding to different types of DoFs in specific
      type of analysis. These are left empty at initialization and should be defined in subclasses.
