Relate Code Module

========================================================================

Convert the relationships between reads and a reference from SAM format
(which encodes relationships implicitly as CIGAR strings) to vectorized
format (which encodes relationships explicitly as elements of arrays).

    Encode the relation between a base in the read and a base in the

    the match encoding if the read and reference bases match, otherwise
    the encoding of the substitution for the base in the read.
    If the read quality is insufficient, then return the fully ambiguous
    base encoding, that is a match or substitution to any base except
    the reference base, since a "substitution to the reference base"
    would be a match, not a substitution.

    ----------
    ref_base: DNA
        Base in the reference sequence.
    read_base: DNA
        Base in the read sequence.
    read_qual: str
        ASCII encoding for the Phred quality score of the read base.
    min_qual: str
        Minimum value of `read_qual` to not call the relation ambiguous.

    A more efficient version of `encode_compare` given prior knowledge

    known substitution because substitutions are relatively infrequent,
