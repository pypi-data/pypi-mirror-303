Asking Questions
================

There are two many venues where all discussions happen: IRC and mailing lists.

Internet Relay Chat 'IRC'
-------------------------

Daily contributor discussions take place on IRC in the ``#openstack-ironic``
channel on the OFTC IRC network.  Please feel free to connect to
``ircs://irc.oftc.net:6697`` and join our channel!

Note that while we have community members from everywhere in the world, we're
the most active from roughly 6am to 12am. If you don't get an answer to your
question, try the `Mailing list`_.

Additional information on getting connected can be found in the
`OpenStack community contribution guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/irc.html>`_.

Mailing list
------------

We use the *openstack-discuss* mailing list for asynchronous communications and
longer discussions. Navigate to
http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss
to subscribe or view the archives.

When sending a message please prefix the *Subject* line with ``[ironic]`` so
that we don't miss it.

Reporting Bugs
==============

LaunchPad
---------

Most of the tools used for OpenStack require a Launchpad_ ID for
authentication. Ironic previously used to track work on Launchpad,
but we have not done so since migrating to Storyboard_.

.. _Launchpad: https://launchpad.net

Storyboard
----------

The ironic project moved from Launchpad to `StoryBoard
<https://storyboard.openstack.org/>`_ for work and task tracking.
This provides an aggregate view called a "Project Group"
and individual "Projects". A good starting place is the
`project group <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project_group/ironic>`_
representing the whole of the ironic community, as opposed to
the `ironic project <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/943>`_
storyboard which represents ironic as a repository.

See :doc:`bugs` for more details on how we track bugs.
