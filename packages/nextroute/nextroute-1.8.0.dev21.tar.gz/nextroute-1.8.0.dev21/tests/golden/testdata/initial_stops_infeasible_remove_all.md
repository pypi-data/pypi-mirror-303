# Initial stop infeasible example (initial_stops_infeasible_remove_all.json)

This example demonstrates the use of the `initial_stops` when all stops need to
be unplanned to make the initial solution feasible.

Find some notes about the example below:

- All stops are simply incompatible with all vehicles due to their
  `compatibility_attributes`. Hence, they all need to be removed from the
  initial solution.
