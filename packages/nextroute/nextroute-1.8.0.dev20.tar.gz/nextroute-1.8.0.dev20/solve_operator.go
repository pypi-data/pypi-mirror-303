// SolveOperator is a solve-operator. A solve-operator is a function that
// modifies the current solution. The function is executed with a certain
// probability. The probability is set by the SetProbability method. The
// probability is used by the solver to determine if the solve-operator should
// be executed. The probability is a value between 0 and 1. The manipulation of
// the solution is implemented in the Execute method. The Execute method will be
// invoked by the solver. The Execute method receives a SolveInformation
// instance that contains information about the current solution and the
// solver. The Execute method should modify the current solution. The
// Execute method should not modify the SolveInformation instance. The Execute
// method should not modify the SolveOperator instance.
