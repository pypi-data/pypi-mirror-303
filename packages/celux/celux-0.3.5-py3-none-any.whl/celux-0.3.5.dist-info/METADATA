# CeLux

**CeLux** is a high-performance Python library for video processing, leveraging the power of FFmpeg. It delivers some of the fastest decode times for full HD videos globally, enabling efficient and seamless video decoding directly into PyTorch tensors.

The name **CeLux** is derived from the Latin words `celer` (speed) and `lux` (light), reflecting its commitment to speed and efficiency.

## üöÄ Features

- **‚ö° Ultra-Fast Video Decoding:** Achieve lightning-fast decode times for full HD videos using hardware acceleration.
- **üîó Direct Decoding to Tensors:** Decode video frames directly into PyTorch tensors for immediate processing.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Hardware Acceleration Support:** Utilize CUDA for GPU-accelerated decoding, significantly improving performance.
- **üîÑ Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with existing Python workflows, making it easy to incorporate into your projects.
- **üóÇÔ∏è Supports Multiple Data Types:** Handle video frames in `uint8`, `float32`, or `float16` data types.

## üì¶ Installation

**CeLux** offers two installation options tailored to your system's capabilities:

1. **CPU-Only Version:** For systems without CUDA-capable GPUs.
2. **CUDA (GPU) Version:** For systems with NVIDIA GPUs supporting CUDA.

### üñ•Ô∏è CPU-Only Installation

Install the CPU version of **CeLux** using `pip`:

```bash
pip install celux
```

**Note:** The CPU version **only** supports CPU operations. Attempting to use GPU features with this version will result in an error.

### üñ•Ô∏è CUDA (GPU) Installation

Install the CUDA version of **CeLux** using `pip`:

```bash
pip install celux-cuda
```

**Note:** The CUDA version **requires** a CUDA-capable GPU and the corresponding Torch-Cuda installation.

### üîÑ Both Packages Import as `celux`

Regardless of the installation choice, both packages are imported using the same module name:

```python
import celux #as cx
```

This design ensures a seamless transition between CPU and CUDA versions without changing your import statements.

## üìö Getting Started

### üéâ Quick Start

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use **CeLux** to read video frames and process them:

```python
import celux as cx

def process_frame(frame):
    # Implement your frame processing logic here
    pass

# Choose device based on your installation
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

with cx.VideoReader(
    "path/to/input/video.mp4",
    device=device,      # "cpu" or "cuda"
    dtype="uint8"       # Options: "uint8", "float32", "float16"
) as reader:
    for frame in reader:
        # Frame is a PyTorch tensor in HWC format
        process_frame(frame)
```

**Parameters:**

- `device` (str): Device to use. Can be `"cpu"` or `"cuda"`.
- `dtype` (str): Data type of the output frames (`"uint8"`, `"float32"`, or `"float16"`).

**Note:** If you set `dtype` to `"float"` or `"half"`, the frame values will be normalized between `0.0` and `1.0`.

### üìú Detailed Usage

**CeLux** allows you to efficiently decode and process video frames with ease. Below are some common operations:

#### Initialize VideoReader

```python
reader = cx.VideoReader(
    "path/to/video.mp4",
    device="cuda",        # Use "cpu" or "cuda"
    dtype="float32",      # Data type: "uint8", "float32", "float16"
    frame_range=[10, 20]  # Optional: Read frames 10 to 20
)
```

#### Iterate Through Frames

```python
for frame in reader:
    # Your processing logic
    pass
```

#### Access Video Properties

```python
properties = reader.get_properties()
print(properties)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

While **CeLux** is easily installable via `pip`, you might want to build it from source for customization or contributing purposes.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Trentonom0r3/celux.git
    cd celux
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Ensure all prerequisites are installed. You can use `vcpkg` for managing dependencies on Windows.

3. **Configure the Project with CMake:**

    ```bash
    cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```

    **Windows Users:** If using Vcpkg, include the toolchain file:

    ```bash
    cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path_to_vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
    ```

4. **Build the Project:**

    ```bash
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

5. **Install the Package:**

    ```bash
    cmake --install build
    ```

6. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    Ensure FFmpeg binaries and other dependencies are in your system's `PATH`. On Unix systems, you might need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
