# Foresight: Advanced Malware Prediction Library

Foresight is a sophisticated malware prediction library that harnesses the power of deep Content Disarm & 
Reconstruction (CDR) analysis data from the Glasswall CDR engine. This data is then fed into a 
Machine Learning (ML) model to achieve its primary objective: providing a probability metric that indicates the 
likelihood of malware presence within a file.

The `gw-foresight` Python module serves as a convenient Python wrapper for the Glasswall Foresight library APIs. 
It allows users to seamlessly integrate malware prediction capabilities into their Python applications.

## Installation

To get started with the `gw-foresight` module, install it via pip:

```sh
pip install gw-foresight
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate its usage:

```python
from gw_foresight import foresight as fs

# Initialize the Foresight object with the path to the Glasswall Foresight library
foresight = fs.Foresight(r"path-to-foresight-library")

# Define paths to the necessary files
input_file = "path-to-input-file"
model_path = "path-to-machine-learning-model"
output_file = "path-to-output-file"
config_file = "path-to-configuration-file"

# Analyze the file and get the malware probability report
fs_report, _, _ = foresight.predict(input_file, model_path, output_file, config_file)

# Print the prediction report
print(fs_report)
```
