Installation
============

The pipeline can be installed from the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/hu-neuro-pipeline>`_ via the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install hu-neuro-pipeline

Alternatively, to install the latest development version directly from `GitHub <https://github.com/alexenge/hu-neuro-pipeline>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/alexenge/hu-neuro-pipeline.git

The pipeline requires Python Version â‰¥ 3.8 and a number of `dependency packages <https://github.com/alexenge/hu-neuro-pipeline/blob/main/setup.py#L49-L57>`_, which will get installed automatically when running the commands above.
