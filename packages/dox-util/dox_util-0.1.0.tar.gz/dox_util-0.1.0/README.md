# Overview

dox_util is a collection of small convenience-features for Sphinx documentations:

- Makes links to external websites more convenient.
- Optimizes built-in linkcheck behaviour of Sphinx.
- Referenceable rules role.
- Several ways to link to source code.
- Tolerant toctree which ignores missing files and other useful directives.
- Light-weight todo role.
- Weak references which do not warn if labels do not exist.
