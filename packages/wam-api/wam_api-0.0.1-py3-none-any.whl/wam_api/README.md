# adc-noaa-pkg

This software package is a collaboration between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center (NOAA SWPC)
and the  University of Maryland App Dev Club. 
Using [outputs](https://noaa-nws-wam-ipe-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) from the Whole Atmosphere Model-Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics (WAM-IPE) model, it allows users to input date, time, and satellite location (longitude + latitude) and output the neutral density value near the satellite at that date and time.
