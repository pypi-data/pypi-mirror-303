**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

dbt is the T in ELT. Organize, cleanse, denormalize, filter, rename, and pre-aggregate the raw data in your warehouse so that it's ready for analysis.

## MaxCompute
This repo contains the base code to help you start to build out your dbt-maxcompute adapter plugin, for more information on how to build out the adapter please follow the [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/contributing/building-a-new-adapter)

** Note ** this `README` is meant to be replaced with what information would be required to use your adpater once your at a point todo so.

** Note **
### Adapter Scaffold default Versioning
This adapter plugin follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The first version of this plugin is v1.7.0, in order to be compatible with dbt Core v1.7.0.

It's also brand new! For MaxCompute-specific functionality, we will aim for backwards-compatibility wherever possible. We are likely to be iterating more quickly than most major-version-1 software projects. To that end, backwards-incompatible changes will be clearly communicated and limited to minor versions (once every three months).

 ## Getting Started

 #### Setting up Locally
- run `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`.
- cd directory into the `dbt-core` you'd like to be testing against and run `make dev`.

 #### Connect to Github
- run `git init`.
- Connect your lcoal code to a Github repo.
