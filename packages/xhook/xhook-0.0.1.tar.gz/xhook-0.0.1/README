# WebSocket Client Python Package

This is a simple Python package that connects to a WebSocket server and consumes messages. It supports basic connection, message handling, and error handling functionality.

## Features

- Connect to a WebSocket server
- Consume and process messages from the WebSocket
- Handle connection and message errors

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `websockets` package

## Installation

You can install the package by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/websocket-client-package.git
cd websocket-client-package
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the websockets package directly if you only need the WebSocket client:

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the package to connect to a WebSocket and consume messages:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets

async def consume_messages():
    uri = "ws://example.com/websocket"

    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        print(f"Connected to {uri}")

        try:
            async for message in websocket:
                print(f"Received: {message}")
                # Add your message processing logic here

        except websockets.ConnectionClosed as e:
            print(f"Connection closed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(consume_messages())
```
