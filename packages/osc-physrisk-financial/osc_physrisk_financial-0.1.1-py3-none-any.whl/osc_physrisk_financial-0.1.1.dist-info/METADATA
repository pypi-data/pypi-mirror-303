## About osc-physrisk-financial

An [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org) project, osc-physrisk-financial
is a library for valuating assets under different climate risk scenarios.

## Using the library

The library can be run locally and is installed via:

```shell
pip install osc-physrisk-financial
```

The library uses the output generated by the
[physrisk](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk) library

### Note

This is the first stage of development, where the models are intentionally
simple, focusing on setting up the proper structure of the library.
