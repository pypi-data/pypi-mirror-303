Installing pymt
---------------

Installing `pymt` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding
`conda-forge` to your channels with:

.. code::

  conda config --add channels conda-forge

*Note*: Before installing `pymt`, you may want to create a separate environment
into which to install it. This can be done with,

.. code::

  conda create -n pymt python=3
  conda activate pymt

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `pymt` can be installed with:

.. code::

  conda install pymt

It is possible to list all of the versions of `pymt` available on your platform with:

.. code::

  conda search pymt --channel conda-forge

--------------------------
Installing pymt_topography
--------------------------

Once `pymt` is installed, the dependencies of `pymt_topography` can
be installed with:

.. code::

  pip install bmi-topography

To install `pymt_topography`,

.. code::

  pip install pymt_topography
