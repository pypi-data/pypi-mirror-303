# Kast

Seamlessly cast your local video files to chromecast type devices.
Regardless of media containers, codecs or subtitle formats.

## Features:

- Detect cast devices in your local network.
- Cast video files compliant with chromecast supported formats withou any extra steps.
- Automatically transcode and remux incompatible video files before casting.
- Automatically convert subtitles.
- Display local preview of streamed video.
- Thanks to the OS media integration, control your stream with a regular remote media control applications intended for your platform.
(e.g. KDE Connect for Plasma linux desktop)

## Supported platforms:

- Windows

(Might work on others, but it's untested.)

## Supported devices:

- Chromecast 4
- Chromecast Ultra
- Chromecast 3

(Might work with others, but it's untested.)

## Local preview backends:

## Installation:

### Binary release:
- Linux Arch - Available at AUR under name `kast-bin`.
- Linux Generic - Download installation script from [here](https://bitbucket.org/massultidev/kast/downloads/).
- Windows - Download installer from [here](https://bitbucket.org/massultidev/kast/downloads/).

### PyPI release:
For satisfying user experience it is recommended to install the application in a separate virtual environment.
You can use your favorite env creation method like conda or venv.

Installation from PyPI using venv:
```sh
python -m venv /path/to/your/venv
cd /path/to/your/venv
source bin/activate
python -m pip install kast
```

## FAQ:

### Local preview does not seem to work (video/audio/both issue).

- First go to: `Application > Settings > Local Player Backend`</br>
- Then try to choose a different backend.</br>
- If PyAV backend is available on your platform, it should be the best option.</br>
- If problem persists try to install codecs on your OS:
    - Linux - Install GStreamer codecs.
    - Windows:
        - Install codecs compatible with Windows Media Foundation. Most notably HEVC codec. Should be available in MS Store.
        - Install codecs compatible with DirectShow. Some codec pack like K-Lite should be enough.

### I see no progress on taskbar on Linux.

Taskbar progress on Linux is supported only by selected desktop environments. (Like KDE or Unity.)

Furthermore, the application would have to be installed in either of root or user environment.

However, both approaches are discouraged and binary installation is recommended.

If you don't want the binary package, please use venv like so:
```sh
# Copy desktop and icon files to user environment:
cp -fv ${your_venv_prefix}/share/applications/* ~/.local/share/applications/
cp -fv ${your_venv_prefix}/share/pixmaps/* ~/.local/share/pixmaps/

# Create launcher script:
echo "#!/usr/bin/sh" > ~/.local/bin/kast
echo "source ${your_venv_prefix}/bin/activate" >> ~/.local/bin/kast
echo "python -m kast" >> ~/.local/bin/kast
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/kast

# Remember to replace all occurrences of the "${your_venv_prefix}" with an actual path to your venv directory!
```
