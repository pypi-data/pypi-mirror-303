# photonx
Collection of scripts useful for photonic design. I will be adding functions as they become useful and document them when possible, but the main goal is for personal use.

# contributing
If you want to build off of these functions and add more, feel free to create a pull request! I don't currently have time to formalize this into a library, and it will likely be very sparse for the time being, but if you are so inclined, you are welcome to help. Just remember to keep every function as simple as possible and well-commented.
