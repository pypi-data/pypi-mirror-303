### 0.4.0

Now requires Sopel 7.1, but also works on (upcoming) Sopel 8.0.


### 0.3.1

Tightened `dnspython` requirement vs. Sopel's own. This plugin now requires
Python 3.6+ (because that's what `dnspython` 2.x supports).


### 0.3.0

Added `[dns]` output prefix. This also meant changing most of the plugin's
output from replies to normal "say", which is fine. The flood of HLs from
looking up stuff like `MX` or `TXT` records could get annoying.

Rate limit has been reduced from 5 minutes to 2 minutes.


### 0.2.1

Fixed error when a DNS query has no answer (no results).


### 0.2.0

Added support for choosing DNS record type to look up. Currently understands
`A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS`, `PTR` (for IP addresses only), and `TXT`.


### 0.1.0

Initial release with support for querying a domain's `A` records.
