Changelog
=========

2.2.0
-----
 - updated interfaces support in catalog indexes, so that objects which don't implement
   an index interface are not referenced anymore in the index; this can lead to different
   behaviour when using the IsNone comparator, as these objects are not referenced anymore
   in the "not indexed" part of the index!
