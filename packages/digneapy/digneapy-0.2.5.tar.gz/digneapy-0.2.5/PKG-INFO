Repository containing the Python version of DIGNEA, a Diverse Instance Generator with Novelty Search and Evolutionary Algorithms. This framework is an extensible tool for generating diverse and discriminatory instances for any desired domain. The instances obtained generated will be biased to the performance of a *target* in a specified portfolio of algorithms.

The DIGNEA tool enables diverse instance suites to be generated for any domain, that are also discriminatory with respect to a set of solvers of the user choice. Written in C++, and delivered as a repository and as a Docker image, its modular and template-based design enables it to be easily adapted to multiple domains and types of solvers with minimal effort. This paper exemplifies how to generate instances for the Knapsack Problem domain.}
