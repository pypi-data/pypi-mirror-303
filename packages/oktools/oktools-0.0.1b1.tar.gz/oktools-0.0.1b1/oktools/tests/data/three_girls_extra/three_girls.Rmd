## Exercises on the three-girl simulation problem

These exercises follow on from the three girls solution in [filling arrays](../03/filling_arrays), and the [reply to the Supreme
Court](../03/reply_supreme).

You may want to refer back to those pages for inspiration.

```{python}
# Don't change this cell; just run it.
import numpy as np  # The array library.

# The OKpy testing system.
from client.api.notebook import Notebook
ok = Notebook('three_girls.ok')
```

### Three girls in a family of four

Remember the solution to this problem, from [filling arrays](../03/filling_arrays)?  Here is a version of that solution:

```{python}
# Reset the counts array to empty (all zeros)
counts_girls = np.zeros(10000)

# Repeat the indented stuff 10000 times.
for i in np.arange(10000):
    # The procedure for one family.
    family = np.random.randint(0, 2, 4)
    count = np.sum(family)
    # Fill in the corresponding value in the counts_girls array.
    counts_girls[i] = count

# Proportion
p_3_girls = np.count_nonzero(counts_girls == 3) / 10000
p_3_girls
```

### No girls in a family of four

Estimate the chances that a 4-child family will have no girls.  You can copy the code from the cell above, and modify it, or you may be able to use variables from the code above, to get the answer, without repeating the simulation.



```{python}
#- Calculate proportion with 0 girls.
p_no_girls = ...
p_no_girls
```

```{python}
_ = ok.grade('q_1_no_girls')
```


For extra points - the answer above is easier to work out with
probability than the chance of three girls.  What's the exact answer, from probability?


Edit this code cell to give your answer.

### Three girls in a family of five

Simulate the chances that a family with 5 children will have
exactly 3 girls.

```{python}
#- Simulate 10000 families of 5 children.
#- Show proportion with 3 girls.
#- Your code below
p_3_of_5 = ...
p_3_of_5
```

```{python}
_ = ok.grade('q_2_three_of_five')
```

### Three or fewer girls in a family of five

Simulate the chances that a family with 5 children will have 3 or
fewer girls.

Hint: you may remember from the [Comparison page](../03/Comparison) that `<=`
tests whether the thing on the left is *less than or equal to* the thing on
the right.

```{python}
3 <= 4
```

```{python}
3 <= 3
```

```{python}
3 <= 2
```

```{python}
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
my_array <= 2
```

Hints done, now:

```{python}
#- Simulate 10000 families of 5 children.
#- Show the proportion of families of 5 children with 3 or fewer girls.
#- Your code below
p_3_or_fewer = ...
p_3_or_fewer
```

```{python}
_ = ok.grade('q_3_three_or_fewer')
```

For extra points - the answer above is easier to work out with
probability than the chance of three girls.  What's the exact answer, from probability?

Hint - you may have got most of the way there with your previous probability answer.

### More realistic simulation

Now we are back to the situation of exactly 3 girls in a family of 4.

In fact, when you have a child, the probability of having a girl
is slightly less than 0.5.

In fact, the [proportion of boys born in the
UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/gender-ratios-at-birth-in-great-britain-2010-to-2014)
is 0.513.  Hence the proportion of girls is 1-0.513 = 0.487.

With that probability of having a girl, what are the chances of having exactly three girls in a family of four?

Hint 1: you may want to use `np.random.uniform`.  Check the help with `np.random.uniform?` followed by Shift-Enter in a new cell.  It works like this:

```{python}
# An array of four random numbers between 0 and 1.
np.random.uniform(0, 1, 4)
```

Hint 2: Let's say I have a random number `x` between 0 and 1:

```{python}
x = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
x
```

The probability that that some returned `x` will be less than - say - 0.25, is 0.25.

```{python}
#- Estimate more accurate chance of having exactly 3 girls
#- in a family of four.
chance_of_girl = 0.487
p_r3_of_4 = ...
p_r3_of_4
```

```{python}
# It is possible, but highly unlikely, that this test will fail even
# when you have the right calculation, because your answer is a little
# random, and it may be very unusual.  If the test fails, and you think
# your answer is right, run it again a few times.
_ = ok.grade('q_4_r_three_of_four')
```

## Done.

Congratulations, you're done with the assignment!  Be sure to:

- **run all the tests** (the next cell has a shortcut for that), 
- **Save and Checkpoint** from the `File` menu,

```{python}
# For your convenience, you can run this cell to run all the tests at once!
import os
_ = [ok.grade(q[:-3]) for q in os.listdir("tests") if q.startswith('q')]
```
