Wrapper methods to do *both* compression and reconstruction for all supported counterfactual compression methodologies.

Runs on 1d ``numpy.ndarray`` inputs.

To find the methods that do *just* compression *or* reconstruction, see the :py:mod:`tsc.utils.compression` and
:py:mod:`tsc.utils.reconstruction` modules, respectively.

Note, the standalone compression and reconstruction methods, and the pipeline for Topological Signal compression are
available with :py:func:`~tsc.__init__.compress_tsc()`, :py:func:`~tsc.__init__.reconstruct_tsc()`, and
:py:func:`~tsc.__init__.tsc_pipeline()` respectively.

        This requires an installation of `opus-tools <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opus-tools>`_ and

        only maintains functionality for the installation of these packages through the ``conda install`` framework.

        only need to be able to run an ``opusenc`` call in a terminal.
