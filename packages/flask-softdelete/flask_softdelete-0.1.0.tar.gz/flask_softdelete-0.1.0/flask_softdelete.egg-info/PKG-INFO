# Flask-Softdelete

Flask-SoftDelete is a simple extension for Flask applications that adds soft delete functionality to Flask-SQLAlchemy models. Instead of permanently deleting records, soft deleting allows you to mark records as "deleted" without actually removing them from the database. This is useful for keeping a history of deleted records or allowing for easy restoration.
