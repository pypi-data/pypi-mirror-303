# Flask-Softdelete

Flask-SoftDelete is a simple extension for Flask applications that adds soft delete functionality to Flask-SQLAlchemy models. Instead of permanently deleting records, soft deleting allows you to mark records as "deleted" without actually removing them from the database. This is useful for keeping a history of deleted records or allowing for easy restoration.

## Installation

To install Flask-Softdelete, use pip:

```bash
pip install Flask-Softdelete
```

## Configuration

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_softdelete import SoftDeleteMixin

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///your_database.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

## Usage

## Base Model

```python
class SampleModel(db.Model, SoftDeleteMixin):
    __tablename__ = 'sample_model'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50))
```

## Record Management Methods

Flask-Softdelete provides the following methods for managing soft delete functionality:

soft_delete(user_id=None): Marks the record as deleted by setting a deleted_at timestamp. You can also specify the ID of the user who performed the deletion.

restore(user_id=None): Restores a soft-deleted record by resetting deleted_at. You can also specify the ID of the user who performed the restoration.

force_delete(): Permanently removes the record from the database, an action that cannot be undone.

get_active(): Retrieves all records that are not soft-deleted.

get_deleted(): Retrieves only the records that have been soft-deleted.

force_delete_all_deleted(): Permanently deletes all records that have been soft-deleted.

restore_all(): Restores all soft-deleted records.

## Examples

# Create a new record

```python
sample = SampleModel(name="Example")
db.session.add(sample)
db.session.commit()
```

# Soft delete the record

```python
sample.soft_delete(user_id=1)
```

# Restore the record

```python
sample.restore(user_id=1)
```

# Permanently delete the record

```python
sample.force_delete()
```

# Retrieve All Active Records

```python
active_records = SampleModel.get_active()
```

# Retrieve All Deleted Records

```python
deleted_records = SampleModel.get_deleted()
```

# Permanently Delete All Deleted Records

```python
SampleModel.force_delete_all_deleted()
```

# Restore All Deleted Records

```python
SampleModel.restore_all()
```

## Logging

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Log soft delete action
logger.info(f"Soft deleted record with ID: {sample.id}")
```
