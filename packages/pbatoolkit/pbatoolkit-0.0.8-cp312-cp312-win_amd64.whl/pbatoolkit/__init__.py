# Some users may not have CUDA Toolkit libraries installed or discoverable.
# They should still be allowed to use pbatoolkit's CPU APIs.
# NOTE: 
# Scenarios (best first, worst last):
# 1. cuda libraries are loaded on first function call to a CUDA API
# 2. cuda libraries are loaded as soon as the gpu submodule is loaded
# 3. cuda libraries are loaded as soon as the _pbat.* dynamic library is loaded
# More details -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50786247/when-is-dynamic-linking-between-a-program-and-a-shared-library-performed
# - Scenario 3. forces pbatoolkit users to have a CUDA GPU and libraries. 
#   In this case, I will need to either distribute 2 packages, pbatoolkit (CPU only) 
#   and pbatoolkit-cuda (with GPU), or use dlopen and LoadLibrary calls.
# - Scenario 2. is handled by the following try/except guard.
