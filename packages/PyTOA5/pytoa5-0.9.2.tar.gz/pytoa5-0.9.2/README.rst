PyTOA5: Utilities for TOA5 Files
================================

This library contains routines for the processing of data files in the TOA5 format.
Since this format is basically a CSV file with a specific header, this library primarily
provides functions to handle the header; the rest of the file can be read with Python's
`csv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html>`_ module. A function to read a TOA5
file into a `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ DataFrame is also provided.

**The documentation is available at** https://haukex.github.io/pytoa5/
