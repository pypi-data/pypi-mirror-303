This package is designed to facilitate many processes that are being/will be
developed. The Design Pattern has been tried to comply with Object Oriented
principles and PEP standards. It will be updated continuously with additions
and corrections.

## corut-0.0.29

It is designed to perform the following operations throughout the process up to
this release. This package is generally used in the main architecture of the *
*PyQT5** and **SmartCRT** desktop application designed for test automation.
However, I decided to continue with this idea to produce solutions without my
own and more useful additional libraries. Therefore, the process from now on
will proceed differently.
