        is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
        annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an

        shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
        name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version

        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
        grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
        irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
        Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
        3. Grant of Patent License.

        irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
        made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
        such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
        that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
        of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
        submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
        Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
        patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
        for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution.
        
        You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
        in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
        provided that You meet the following conditions:
        
        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
        this License; and
        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
        changed the files; and
        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
        all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works; and
        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
        Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
        attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
        following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
        Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
        with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
        Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
        the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
        provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
        modifying the License.
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
        distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
        provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
        with the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions.
        
        Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
        for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
        conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
        any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
        such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks.
        
        This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
        service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
        reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
        reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
        
        Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
        Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
        including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
        solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
        redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
        permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability.
        
        In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
        contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
        out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
        damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
        any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
        been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
        
        While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
        offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
        in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
        sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
        agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
        accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work
        
        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
        notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
        identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be

        recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on
        the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier identification within
        third-party archives.

title: Missing TV Shows for Kodi
---

The [missingTvShows](https://github.com/digsim/missingTvShows) compares
the locally available tv show episodes managed by Kodi with the official
ones avaialbe on the tvdb and prints a summary containing 4 sections: \*
TV Show Seasons which where all published episodes are locally available
and \* none has been watched \* some have already been watched \* TV
Show Seasons which where some published episodes are not available
locally and \* none has been watched \* some have already been watched

# Installation

* Create virtualenv `virtualenv -p /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 venv-312`
* Active virtualenv `source venv-312/bin/activate.bash`
* Install software locally `pip install .`

# Usage

Simply launch [missingTvShows]{.title-ref} to get help and instructions
on how to use the tool

```bash
└─\> master 🕙 12:29:38 ❯ missingTvShows -h usage: missingtvshows
\[-h\] \[-v\] {sync} \...

Checks missing TV Show Episodes based on the list of available
Episodes on thetvdb.com

positional arguments: {sync} commands sync sync Kodi and TVDB

options: -h, \--help show this help message and exit -v, \--version
show program\'s version number and exit

missingtvshows {command} -h for help on individual commands
```

The `missingTvShows` relies on two config files sitting in
`~/.MissingTVShows`:

-   `tvshows.conf` : main configuration file of missingTvShows.
-   `logging.conf`: logging configuration

These two files are created on the first run and at least the
`tvshows.conf` need to be adapted accordingly:


```
[Config]
api_key: <thetvdb_api_key>
tvdbdb:  ./tvdbdb.db # location of the sqlite3 cache of tvdb information relative to this file
[Database] # coordinates of the Kodi DB, supports mysql and sqlite3
#dialect: sqlite
#db: /Volumes/Data/ruppena/Documents/Programming/Python/missing_tv_shows_for_xbmc/test.db
dialect: mysql # one of mysql, sqlite
db: MyVideos121 # in case of mysql the name of the DB in case of sqlite3 the full filepath
user: <mysql_user>
passwd: <mysql_passwor>
hostname: <mysql_host>
port:<mysql_port>
```

and it produces the following two files (also in `~/.MissingTVShows`):

* `tvdbdb.db` : cached thetvdb information
* `tvshows.log` : log of the last run
