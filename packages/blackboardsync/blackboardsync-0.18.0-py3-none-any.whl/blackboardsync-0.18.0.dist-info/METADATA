## About

Being a student in this day and age means constantly having to
keep up to date with the files that are uploaded to the student portal.
I needed a tool that would take care of retrieving these files for me,
allowing me to focus on the work to be done.
Something I could set up and forget about.

What I was looking for in such an application was:

- Automatic syncing with minimal intervention after the initial setup
- Graphical interface
- Cross-platform compatibility
- It would make use of the [Blackboard REST API][blackboard-api]

### [60+ Universities](UNIVERSITIES.md) Supported Around the World

To provide support for a specific university, it is necessary to have
some knowledge about its login process.
