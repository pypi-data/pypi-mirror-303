## getseq.py
## 
## getseq.py contains all the user-facing function associated with getSequence. 
## If a new function is added it should be included
## here and added to the __all__ list
## 

'''
Note:
Some of the way getseq is written seems a bit redundant (see get_sequence.py). 
This is because getseq was originally made primarily for use
in other packages that I have. Some of the ways this is implemented
is rather particular, which has constrained how I update the code
in getseq. It's honestly easier to have some redundancy here
than to fix all the bugs I would inevitably introduce in all my
other packages that use getseq by updating and refactoring this code. 

yerp that code is scary looking - I'm also going to ignore it. ~jeff

    '''
    User facing functionality to get sequences. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    query : str or list
        A single query to search for as a string or
        a list of queries to search for.
    uniprot_id : bool
        Whether or not to use the uniprot id.
    just_sequence : bool
        Whether or not to just return the sequence.
    return_dict : bool
        Whether or not to return a dictionary.
    ignore_failures : bool
        Whether or not to ignore failures.
    output_file : str
        The output file to write the sequences to.

    Returns
    -------
    list or dict
        If output_file is None,
            by default returns a nested list where the first element 
            in each list is the uniprot header and the second is the sequence. 
            If return_dict is True, returns a dictionary where the keys are the 
            uniprot headers and the values are the sequences.
        If output_file is not None,
            None. Just saves the output.
