## Overview

The Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE) works in tandem with LLMs to ensure generated output conforms to a defined JSON schema.

The PSE enables error free custom tool calling, complex multi-step reasoning, and unlocks new creative possibilities for AI applications.

PSE achieves this through a novel schema-guided sampling approach, leveraging a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG) and finite state machines.

### Installation

```bash
pip install pse
```

### Features

* **JSON Schema Sampling:** Enforces schema constraints while maintaining creativity in model outputs.
* **Enhanced Tool Calling:** Enables precise tool integration by guaranteeing valid JSON output, streamlining workflows and automation.
* **Universal Compatibility:** Works with any LLM that provides logits or log probabilities, both locally and via API.
* **Enhanced Creativity:** Balances structure with quality, generating actionable and creative outputs that meet your schema requirements.
* **Performance Optimized:** Incorporates several optimizations for speed and efficiency, including:
    * **DAWG (Directed Acyclic Word Graph):** Efficiently validates tokens against the schema.
    * **Lazy Evaluation with Logits:** Processes tokens only as needed.
* **Expanded Schema Support:** Supports JSON Schema with plans to expand to other formats (SQL, Cypher, Python, U-DIFF).
* **Direct HuggingFace Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with HuggingFace `transformers`.
* **Comprehensive Unit Testing:** Ensures code reliability with 90% test coverage.
* **Detailed Documentation and Type Hinting:** Improves readability and developer experience.
* **Hooks for Custom Logic:** `start_hook` and `end_hook` callbacks enable custom logic injection.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Facilitates debugging and integration.

## Benchmarks

The Proxy Structuring Engine consistently outperforms traditional sampling methods in both speed and accuracy:

## Acknowledgements

The PSE builds upon the groundwork laid by [LLM Structured Output](https://github.com/otriscon/llm-structured-output) and utilizes [lexpy](https://github.com/aosingh/lexpy) for efficient lexicon analysis.
