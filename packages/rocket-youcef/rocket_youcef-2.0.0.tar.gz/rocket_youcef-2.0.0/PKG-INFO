# package_name

`rocket_youcef` is a Python library for simulating and manipulating rocket objects, including their movement and different properties.
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install `rocket`.

```bash
pip install rocket_youcef
```

## Usage

```python
import rocket_youcef

# creates a Rocket instance, has 2 parameters X and Y
# default is position (0,0) if no parameters given

rocket1=rocket_youcef.Rocket(4,5)

# creates a Shuttle Rocket instance, has 3 parameters X and Y and flights_completed
# default is postition (0,0) and 0 flights completed if no parameters given
rocket2=rocket_youcef.Shuttle(3,6,10)

# creates a Circular Rocket instance, has 3 paramateres: X and Y and Radius 
# default is postition (0,0) and radius=1
rocket3=rocket_youcef.CircleRocket(3,3,5)


## Shared Methods:

# Calculates the distance from this rocket to another rocket,
# and returns that value.
get_distance(rocket1,rocket2)

# Move the rocket according to the paremeters given.
#  Default behavior is to move the rocket up one unit.
move_rocket(rocket1,10,5)

## Class specific Methods:

## CircleRocket

# returns Rocket Area
rocket3.get_area()

# returns Rocket Circumference
rocket3.get_circumference()
```
