# Title: High Code Solution for PromptArchitect

**Decision ID:** DEC-2024-02

**Date:** August 30, 2024

## Decision

We have decided to build **PromptArchitect as a high code solution** to optimize business processes, focusing on providing extensive customization options rather than low code features like automatic generation of web forms.

## Context

- The primary users of PromptArchitect are skilled developers and domain experts who require deep customization and flexibility in designing and optimizing AI-driven business processes.
- A high code approach allows users to tailor solutions to specific business needs, leveraging their technical expertise without the constraints often associated with low code platforms.
- The focus on high code ensures that the tool can cater to complex, enterprise-level use cases where precision, control, and scalability are paramount.

## Options Considered

1. **High Code Solution** (Chosen):
   - Pros: Provides maximum flexibility and customization, allowing for precise tailoring to complex business processes.
   - Cons: Requires a higher level of technical expertise from users, which may limit accessibility to non-technical stakeholders.

2. **Low Code Solution**:
   - Pros: Easier for non-technical users to adopt, with features like automatic generation of web forms to simplify common tasks.
   - Cons: Limited customization options, which could hinder the ability to meet complex, specific business requirements. Risk of vendor lock-in due to reliance on pre-built, less customizable components.

3. **Hybrid Solution**:
   - Pros: Combines some low code features with high code capabilities, aiming to balance flexibility with ease of use.
   - Cons: Increased complexity in development and maintenance, potentially diluting the productâ€™s focus and introducing compromises in both flexibility and usability.

## Consequences

- **Short-Term**: The initial development will be more complex, requiring a focus on building robust customization tools and detailed documentation to support developers and prompt engineers.
- **Long-Term**: The high code approach positions PromptArchitect as a powerful tool for enterprises looking to implement highly customized AI-driven solutions, potentially limiting the market to organizations with sufficient technical resources but ensuring a strong fit for complex use cases.

## Follow-Up Actions

- Develop comprehensive documentation and best practices to support users in leveraging the full potential of the high code features.
- Monitor user feedback and adoption to ensure the high code solution meets user needs effectively and identify any areas where additional support or tools may be needed.
- Reevaluate the decision if market demands shift significantly towards low code solutions or if feedback indicates a strong demand for simpler, more automated features.
