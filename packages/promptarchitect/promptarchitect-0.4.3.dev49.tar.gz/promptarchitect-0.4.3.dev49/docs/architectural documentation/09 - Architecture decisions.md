# 9. Architecture Decisions

## 9.1 Overview

This section documents the key architectural decisions made during the development of the system. Each decision is described with its context, the alternatives considered, the rationale for the chosen approach, and any implications for the system.

### 9.2 Decision: Adoption of OpenTelemetry

**Context**:
PromptArchitect requires a robust and flexible system for logging and monitoring that can be easily integrated into existing infrastructures.

**Decision**:
OpenTelemetry was chosen as the protocol for collecting and transmitting telemetry data. This decision supports the system's goals of openness and interoperability, allowing organizations to integrate PromptArchitect’s telemetry with their existing monitoring systems.

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. **Proprietary Monitoring Protocols**:
   - **Pros**: Could offer deeper integration within a specific ecosystem.
   - **Cons**: Limits flexibility and could lead to vendor lock-in.

2. **No Standard Protocol**:
   - **Pros**: Simplifies the system by removing dependency on external protocols.
   - **Cons**: Significantly reduces the ability to integrate with existing monitoring solutions.

**Rationale**:
OpenTelemetry is an open and widely supported protocol that aligns with the project’s principles of openness and flexibility. It provides a standardized way to collect and transmit telemetry data, which can be easily integrated into a variety of monitoring systems.

**Implications**:

- **Scalability**: OpenTelemetry supports a wide range of use cases, making it suitable for organizations of any size.
- **Customization**: While the standard collector provides a quick start, organizations can implement custom collectors if needed to fit specific requirements.
