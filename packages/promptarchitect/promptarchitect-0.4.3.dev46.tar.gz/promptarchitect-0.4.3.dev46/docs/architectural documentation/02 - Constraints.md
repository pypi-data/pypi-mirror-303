# 2. Constraints

## 2.1 Technical Constraints

### AI Model Compatibility

- **Constraint**: The engineered prompts must be compatible with multiple AI models from different providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Open Source, Ollama).
- **Rationale**: To ensure flexibility and usability across various AI platforms and maintain compatibility with future updates, including locally hosted models like those supported by Ollama.
- **Impact**: Prompts must be designed and tested for compatibility with each supported AI model, considering differences in their API structures, response behaviors, and the potential need for local infrastructure support.

### Versioning and Documentation

- **Constraint**: Comprehensive versioning and documentation are mandatory for all engineered prompts.
- **Rationale**: To manage prompt evolution, facilitate maintenance, and ensure clarity in prompt usage.
- **Impact**: All changes to prompts must be tracked with version numbers, and documentation must be updated to reflect these changes, including the design rationale, expected outputs, and any specific instructions for using Ollama-supported models.

### Testing and Validation

- **Constraint**: Rigorous testing and validation procedures must be applied to all engineered prompts.
- **Rationale**: To ensure prompts generate the expected outputs reliably and consistently.
- **Impact**: Prompts require unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, and regression testing. Special attention must be given to testing prompts with Ollama models to ensure they function correctly in a local environment and across different hardware configurations.

## 2.2 Organizational Constraints

### Development Process

- **Constraint**: A structured development process must be followed for creating and maintaining engineered prompts.
- **Rationale**: To ensure consistency, quality, and adherence to best practices in prompt engineering.
- **Impact**: Development teams must adhere to predefined processes for prompt creation, testing, validation, and deployment, with additional steps to manage the integration of locally hosted models like those supported by Ollama.

### Licensing

- **Constraint**: The project is licensed under the MIT License.
- **Rationale**: To provide clear terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed.
- **Impact**: All contributors and users must comply with the terms of the MIT License.

## 2.3 Regulatory Constraints

No regulatory constraints apply.

## 2.4 Conventions

### Naming Conventions

- **Constraint**: Standard naming conventions must be used for prompt files and versions.
- **Rationale**: To ensure clarity and consistency in prompt identification and usage.
- **Impact**: All prompt files must follow the predefined naming conventions, including clear version identifiers and descriptive names, with considerations for distinguishing between prompts designed for cloud-based and locally hosted models.

### Coding Standards

- **Constraint**: Prompts must adhere to established coding standards and best practices.
- **Rationale**: To maintain code quality and readability.
- **Impact**: All code related to prompt execution must follow the agreed-upon coding standards, including documentation, formatting, and commenting practices. This includes ensuring compatibility with the execution environment, particularly when working with locally hosted Ollama models.
