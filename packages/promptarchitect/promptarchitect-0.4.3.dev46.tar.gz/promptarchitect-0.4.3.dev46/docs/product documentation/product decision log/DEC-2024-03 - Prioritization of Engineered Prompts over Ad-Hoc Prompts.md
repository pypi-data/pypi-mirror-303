# Prioritization of Engineered Prompts over Ad-Hoc Prompts

**Decision ID:** DEC-2024-03

**Date:** August 30, 2024

## Decision

PromptArchitect is primarily built to support **Engineered Prompts**. While we also support ad-hoc prompts for convenience, the system is designed to prioritize Engineered Prompts whenever there's a conflict of interest. Ad-hoc prompts are supported to leverage the platform’s benefits such as easy provider and model selection, and extensive logging and monitoring, but the core focus remains on optimizing Engineered Prompts.

## Context

- **Engineered Prompts** are central to the mission of PromptArchitect, as they allow for precise control, testing, and optimization to meet specific business objectives.
- **Ad-Hoc Prompts** offer flexibility and ease for quick, less formal use cases, allowing users to benefit from the platform’s features without the need for extensive setup.
- By prioritizing Engineered Prompts, we ensure that the system remains focused on delivering high-quality, reliable, and consistent AI-driven processes that align with strategic business goals.

## Options Considered

1. **Prioritize Engineered Prompts** (Chosen):
   - Pros: Maintains the integrity and reliability of the system by focusing on well-defined, tested, and optimized prompts. Ensures that the platform’s advanced features are fully leveraged to deliver superior outcomes.
   - Cons: Ad-hoc prompts may not fully utilize all system capabilities and might not always align perfectly with the platform's primary objectives.

2. **Equal Support for Engineered and Ad-Hoc Prompts**:
   - Pros: Flexibility for users to choose between detailed prompt engineering and quick ad-hoc usage without any prioritization.
   - Cons: Potential dilution of the platform’s focus on high-quality, optimized prompt usage, leading to inconsistencies in output quality.

3. **Focus Exclusively on Engineered Prompts**:
   - Pros: Complete alignment with the platform’s mission to optimize business processes through meticulously engineered prompts.
   - Cons: Limits flexibility and convenience for users needing quick and informal prompt testing or usage, reducing overall user accessibility.

## Consequences

- **Short-Term**: Users will be able to experiment with ad-hoc prompts, but with the understanding that the full benefits of the platform are realized through Engineered Prompts. Any conflicts between features for ad-hoc and Engineered Prompts will be resolved in favor of the latter.
- **Long-Term**: The platform remains dedicated to delivering the highest quality outcomes through Engineered Prompts, with ad-hoc prompts serving as a convenient, but secondary, feature.

### Follow-Up Actions

- Educate users on the benefits of Engineered Prompts and how they can maximize value from the platform by adopting this approach.
- Monitor usage patterns to ensure that the ad-hoc prompt feature is meeting user needs without compromising the system's core objectives.
- Reassess the balance between ad-hoc and Engineered Prompts based on user feedback and evolving business requirements.
