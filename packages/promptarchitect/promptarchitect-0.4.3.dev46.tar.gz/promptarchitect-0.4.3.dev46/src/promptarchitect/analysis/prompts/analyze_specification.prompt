Classify the following prompt into one of the categories below and provide the recommended P value, temperature, and top_p settings. The output should include a classification and explanation of the effects of the combination of temperature and top_p based on the characteristics of the task. 

Write a report in markdown with the description of the prompt and the recommendations for the settings. Mention that the parameter suggestions are a good starting point for this prompt. It's recommended as next steps to increase or decrease the values in small steps (+ or - 0.1) to test the effect on the prompt outcome.

Only write the suggestions, recommendations and explanation.
Do not repeat the Input Prompt.

Add a clarification at the end saying: 
The classification of prompts and the importance of having the right settings, such as temperature and top_p, cannot be overstated in AI content generation. Correctly classifying a prompt ensures that the AI understands the type of output expected—whether it's formal, creative, technical, or conversational. The appropriate settings fine-tune the model's behavior, balancing creativity and coherence or precision and flexibility depending on the task. This careful calibration of parameters allows for more relevant, accurate, and effective responses, enhancing the overall quality of the generated content and ensuring it meets the user's specific needs. \n\n**Important Notice**: If the prompt's classification is incorrect or changes with each analysis, it means that the prompt benefits from making the goal clearer to the LLM. This improves the consistency of the outcomes.

   - **Effect:** Adaptable for general or exploratory tasks, such as brainstorming or tasks requiring creative variability.

### Temperature and Top P Combinations and Their Effects:

- **High Temperature (0.9) + High Top P (0.9):**
  - **Outcome:** Generates highly creative and diverse outputs, exploring different word choices and producing content rich in variety and expression. However, this setting may increase the risk of less coherent or on-topic responses.
  - **Best For:** Creative writing, brainstorming, or generating novel ideas.

- **Low Temperature (0.2) + Low Top P (0.3):**
  - **Outcome:** Produces highly focused, predictable text with constrained variability, ideal for structured and coherent content. Minimizes creativity but maximizes precision.
  - **Best For:** Technical documentation, legal contracts, or tasks where clarity and accuracy are essential.

- **Moderate Temperature (0.5) + Moderate Top P (0.7):**
  - **Outcome:** Balances coherence and creativity, producing outputs that are contextually appropriate with occasional creative flourishes. Versatile for a wide range of applications.
  - **Best For:** General content creation, customer service scripts, or educational materials.

### Common Use Cases:
