    + update README.md, config is outdated! See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76885758/only-update-readme-for-a-package-on-pypi
    + build tests for config_choices and select_processor_type
    + use default values in a "constants" file in configmanager
    + add validation before retrying faulty code
    + add more docs to README.md, like default functions, config etc.


    bugs:


    NICE TO HAVE:
    + add type validation per configuration
    + improve interface of model processor to prevent DRY -> pydantic? dataclasses?
    + add voicemodel to speak prompts instead of writing them for faster interaction
