## ask-llm: the easiest way to supercharge your apps with LLM!
ask-llm is a very simple yet powerful package that can turn anything into a LLM interaction.  
You just need to decorate a function with `@ask()`, write a prompt into the docstring, give it a return type, and there you go, you got your LLM interaction.  
This takes inspiration from the awesome langchain-decorators package.  
It works out of the box with OpenAI and Anthropic (by setting a `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var), but is compatible with all `BaseChatModel` from Langchain.

## Features
- Write your prompts in docstrings using Jinja templating language. 
- Access your function args in your prompt.  
- (Almost) full access in your prompt to every attributes / properties of objects as soon as it's not a callable.  
- Conversation support
- Fully compatible with Langchain / LCEL. Returns either the LLM response, the formatted `ChatPromptTemplate` or a chain `prompt | llm`.  
- Access the decorated function return value inside your prompt. Use `{{ __result__ }}` anywhere in your prompt.  
- Format the LLM answer using Pydantic objects as return type, or regular python return types.  
- If passed a Pydantic object as return type, LLM will retry if it fails to answer on the first shot.  
- If using GPT Vision, supports an `image` parameter to send alongside your prompt. You can input your image either as an url, a path, or a base64 string.  
and many more to come...

### Installation
Either using `pip` or by cloning this repo. 
`pip install ask-llm`

Then, import the decorator:
`from ask_llm import ask`

To make it work out of the box with OpenAI, define an env var:
`OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>`

Now, you are able to use the decorator:
```python
import requests
from functools import cached_property
from ask_llm import ask
from pydantic import BaseModel


class BlogArticle(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str


class WikipediaAPI:
    def __init__(self, title: str):
        self.title = title

    @cached_property
    def wikipedia_article(self) -> str | None:
        try:
            response = requests.get(
                f"https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{self.title}"
            )
            return response.json()["extract"]
        except:
            return


class BlogArticleWriter:
    def __init__(
        self,
        title: str,

        input_bulletpoints: bool,
    ):
        self.title = title
        self.keywords = keywords
        self.nb_headings = nb_headings
        self.nb_paragraphs = nb_paragraphs
        self.input_bulletpoints = input_bulletpoints

        self.wikipedia_api = WikipediaAPI(title=self.title)

    @ask()
    def write_blog_article(self, author: str) -> BlogArticle:

An other example, with an image:
```python
from ask_llm import ask


@ask()
def describe_image(image: str) -> str:
    """
    Describe this image precisely.
    """


description = describe_image(image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Tour_Eiffel_Wikimedia_Commons_%28cropped%29.jpg/800px-Tour_Eiffel_Wikimedia_Commons_%28cropped%29.jpg")

Conversation example:
```python
from ask_llm import ask


@ask()
def conversation(instruction: str) -> str:
    """
    {% chat %}
        {% message system %}
            You are an helpful assistant that can answer all the user questions.
        {% endmessage %}
        {% message ai %}
            Hello, Arnaud! How can I help you today?
        {% endmessage %}
        {% message human %}
            {{ instruction }}
        {% endmessage %}
    {% endchat %}
    Answer in CAPS LOCK
    """
```


### Settings  
You can pass numerous arguments to the decorator:  
- `call: bool = True` To call the LLM or to return the prepared chain `prompt | llm`  
- `verbose: bool = False` To enable verbose mode  
- `return_prompt_only: bool = False` To return only the formatted `ChatPromptTemplate`  
- `model_name: str = "gpt-4-vision-preview"` The model name  
- `max_tokens: int = 4096` max tokens for the answer  
- `image_quality: str = "high"` If passed an image, the quality parameter for Vision API  
- `chat_model_class: BaseChatModel = ChatOpenAI` The Langchain subclass of `BaseChatModel` to use.  
- `**llm_kwargs` Other kwargs to pass to the `BaseChatModel` if any.
