# Ciola
Ciola is a library created FOR PERSONAL USE, but it can also be used by you. Honestly, I don't really care, but remember that if you use it, you won't find any documentation or support from me.

# Functions
1) Mail Generator
2) Password Generator
3) User Agent Generator
4) Human Behavior Functions for web automation (playwright)
Other utils will be added!
