# üéÆ Auro Joystick

Auro Joystick is a Python library designed for interfacing with joystick devices in robotics applications, offering robust support for ROS to facilitate easy integration.

![Joystick ROS Control](docs/images/ros_control.gif)

## üöÄ Features

- **Joystick Detection:** Automatically identifies supported joystick devices.
- **Event Handling:** Efficiently processes input events for joystick buttons and axes.
- **ROS Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both ROS1 and ROS2 for robotic systems.
- **Configurable Logging:** Delivers comprehensive logging for straightforward debugging.
- **Custom Event Handlers:** Supports the registration of custom event handlers for specific joystick actions.

## üß™ Testing Conditions

Auro Joystick has been tested on the `Beitong` gamepad.

It is also compatible with other controllers that follow the `Xbox` layout.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install Auro Joystick, you can use one of the following methods:

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install auro_joystick
```

```bash
# Install from the current directory (local development)
pip install .
```

## üî• Quickstart

You can find detailed examples for the project in the `examples` directory of the repository.

### Print Input

This example will display the current inputs and corresponding values from your gamepad:

```bash
python examples/print_input.py
```

### ROS Example

Use the `left joystick` to control the movement of a turtle in Turtlesim, while the `right joystick` will manage its rotation.

Press the `B` key to reset the turtle.

```bash
# [Terminal 1]
# Run roscore
roscore
```

```bash
# [Terminal 2]
# Run Turtlesim
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

```bash
# [Terminal 3]
# Run the example
python examples/control_ros_turtlesim.py
```

### Minimal Code Example

This example will call a function when the `A` button is pressed.

```python
import time
from auro_joystick import AuroJoystick


# Your callback function
def on_button_a_pressed():
    print("Button A pressed!")


# Init the joystick
joystick = AuroJoystick()
# Register the function for button A
joystick.register_event_handler(on_button_a_pressed, "button_a_pressed")

# Start the joystick
joystick.start()

# Your loop
while True:
    time.sleep(0.05)
```

```bash
python examples/minimal.py
```

## üôã Troubleshooting

### Joystick Device Not Found

```python
ValueError: Joystick device not found
```

<details> <summary> Click here to see the solution </summary>
It means that the system couldn't find your joystick.

- Step 1: How AuroJoystick Finds Devices

    AuroJoystick automatically searches for devices matching certain keywords, like `["pad", "X-Box", "360"]`.

- Step 2: Manual Device Path Setup

    If the joystick isn‚Äôt found automatically, you can manually specify the device path.

    ```bash
    # Install input-utils
    sudo apt-get install input-utils
    # List input devices
    sudo lsinput
    ```

- Step 3: Find the Joystick Device

   Look for a device that looks like this:

   ```bash
   /dev/input/event17
      bustype : BUS_USB
      vendor  : 0x45e
      product : 0x28e
      version : 256
      name    : "Microsoft X-Box 360 pad"
      phys    : "usb-0000:00:14.0-6.4/input0"
   ```

- Step 4: Use the Device Path

    In your code, specify the path:

    ```python
    joystick = AuroJoystick(device_path="/dev/input/event17")
    ```

</details>

### Permission Denied for Input Device

```bash
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/input/event18'
```

<details> <summary> Click here to see the solution </summary>
This error means the program does not have the necessary permissions to access the device.

- Step 1: Grant Temporary Permissions

    To give your program temporary access, you can change the permissions of the device using the `chmod` command:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 777 /dev/input/event18
    ```

    This grants read, write, and execute permissions for all users. Note that this is temporary and will be reset after a reboot.

    This ensures your joystick device is accessible every time it's plugged in.
