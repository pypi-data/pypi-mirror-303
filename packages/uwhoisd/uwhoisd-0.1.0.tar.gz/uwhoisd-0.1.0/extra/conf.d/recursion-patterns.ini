; Thin registries do not manage contact information and rely on registrars to
; perform that particular duty. For those we need to perform recursive queries,
; first querying the registry for the registrar's WHOIS server, and then
; querying the registrar's WHOIS server for the actual domain data.
;
; Below are listed regular expression for extracting the WHOIS server from
; registry WHOIS responses. Listing a zone below also identifies it as being
; operated by a thin registry.
