wocecolormap package

This package is intended to transfer the colormaps used in World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) to Python for use in data visualization. The code was created by Megan Siwak, and packaged by Emma Holtzman. All of this was conducted under the guidance of Dr. Rebecca Beadling at Temple University. This package was built for students working under Dr. Beadling to have access to these color palettes, but are availible for anyone to use. They were specifically created for use with WOCE data, but the color palettes can be applied elsewhere.
