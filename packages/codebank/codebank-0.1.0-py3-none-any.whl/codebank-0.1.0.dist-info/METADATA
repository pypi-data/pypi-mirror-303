### A Python Package for Easy Access to Predefined Code Snippets for Exams

This package provides easy access to predefined Python code snippets that can be directly used in exams or coding assessments. By calling simple functions, users can retrieve code examples on various topics, copy the output from the console, and paste it into their compiler or editor for execution.

---

### **Features**
- Predefined code snippets for common Python problems.
- Easy-to-use function calls.
- Useful for exam preparation and quick reference.
  
---

### **Installation**

To install the package, use pip:

```bash
pip install your_package_name
```

---

### **Usage**

After installation, you can import the package and start retrieving predefined code snippets by calling simple functions.

#### **Example 1: Retrieve a Function to Find Prime Numbers**

```python
from numpyy.mllab import one

# Call the function to retrieve the code
code_snippet = one()

# The code will be printed in the console, and you can copy it
print(code_snippet)
```

Output:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

#### **Example 2: Retrieve a Sorting Algorithm (Bubble Sort)**

```python
from numpyy.mllab import two

code_snippet = two()
print(code_snippet)
```

Output:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

### **Available Functions**

- `one()`: Returns a Python function to check if a number is prime.
- `two()`: Returns a bubble sort implementation.
- `three()`: Returns a Python function to generate a Fibonacci sequence.
- `four()`: Returns a function to compute the factorial of a number.
- More functions can be added to cover additional topics such as searching, recursion, data structures, etc.

### **How to Use**

1. **Copy the Code**: After calling a function, copy the printed code snippet from the console.
2. **Paste and Run**: Paste it into your Python editor or compiler.
3. **Modify (Optional)**: If required, you can modify the function parameters or extend the code as per your needs.
