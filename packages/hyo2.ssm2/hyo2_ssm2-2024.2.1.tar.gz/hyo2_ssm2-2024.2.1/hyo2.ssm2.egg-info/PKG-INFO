General Info
------------

The HydrOffice's Sound Speed package provides a library and tools to manage sound speed profiles.
The package is part of HydrOffice, a research development framework for ocean mapping.  HydrOffice aims to provide
a collection of hydro-packages to deal with specific issues in the field, speeding up both algorithms testing and
research-to-operation (R2O).

Among the tools developed in the package, Sound Speed Manager (SSM) is a software application that provides the user
with a streamlined workflow to perform accurate processing and management of sound speed profiles
for underwater acoustic systems.

SSM has been designed to ease integration into existing data acquisition workflows.
The liberal open source license used by the project (specifically, GNU LGPL) provides for understanding
of the chosen processing solutions through ready inspection of the source code, as well as the ability
to adapt the application to specific organization needs.

This adaptation is eased by the modular design of the application, with the NOAA-specific
functionalities organized so that they can be easily deactivated for non-NOAA users.

The main functionalities include:

* Wide support of commonly-used sound speed profile formats
* Compatibility with various data sources
* Integration with common data acquisition/integration applications (e.g., Kongsberg SIS)
* Profile enhancement based on real-time and climatologic models
* Database management of the collected data with built-in functionalities for analysis and visualization.

With a long-term support and development plan, Sound Speed Manager is a turnkey application ready
to be used (and extended) by professionals and institutions in the hydrographic community.

The package is jointly developed by the `Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, UNH <https://ccom.unh.edu/>`_ and
`NOAA Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL) <https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/>`_.

How to contribute
-----------------

Every open source project lives from the generous help by contributors that sacrifice their time and this is no different.

Public Repositories
===================

The source code is available on `GitHub`_.

To propose changes to Sound Speed Manager, you can follow the common Fork & Pull Request workflow.
If you are not familiar with such a workflow, a good starting point may be this `short tutorial`_.


Coding Style
============

To make participation as pleasant as possible, this project adheres to the `Code of Conduct`_ by the Python Software Foundation.

Here are a few hints and rules to get you started:

* Add yourself to the AUTHORS.txt_ file in an alphabetical fashion. Every contribution is valuable and shall be credited.
* If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the changelog_.
* No contribution is too small; please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
* Don't *ever* break backward compatibility.
* *Always* add tests and docs for your code. This is a hard rule; patches with missing tests or documentation won't be merged.
  If a feature is not tested or documented, it does not exist.
* Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
* Write `good commit messages`_.
* Ideally, `collapse`_ your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.

.. note::
   If you have something great but are not sure whether it adheres -- or even can adhere -- to the rules
   above: **please submit a pull request anyway**!
   In the best case, we can mold it into something, in the worst case the pull request gets politely closed.
   There's absolutely nothing to fear.

Thank you for considering to contribute! If you have any question or concerns, feel free to reach out to us.

Development Quick-start
=======================

Clone and install (in development mode) the `GitHub` repo:

* `git clone https://github.com/hydroffice/hyo2_soundspeed.git`
* `pip install -e hyo2_soundspeed`

The previous steps will also install all the required dependencies.

If you have issues installing `hyo2.abc2`_, you may want to:

* `git clone https://github.com/hydroffice/hyo2_abc2.git`
* `pip install -e hyo2_abc2`

For other issues installing dependencies (e.g., `GDAL`_), you may want to use `Anaconda`_.
