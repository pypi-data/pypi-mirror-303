```{python}
import numpy as np
```

All the cells below have errors in syntax or in logic. A syntax error happens
when the code does not correspond to Python's rules; Python generates an error
with some information about which bit of the code caused the problem.  A logic
error is where the code does run, but does not do what it was intended to do.
Run the cells to see the error, and then fix them to work correctly.

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
#- Print the numbers 0 through 2
for my_var in np.arange(3)
    print(my_var)
```

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
#- Add up all the numbers from 3 through 10
total = 0
for i in np.arange(3, 11):
total = total + i
print(total)
```

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
#- Print all the numbers from 5 through 9
for p in 56789:
    print(p)
```

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
#- Add all numbers from 3 down to -2, inclusive
total = 0
for i = np.arange(3, -4, -1):
    total = total + i
print(total)
```

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
#- Add up the squares of all the even numbers from -2 through 20
total = 0
for v in np.arange(-2, 21):
    squared = v ** 2
     total = total + squared
print(total)
```

```{python}
#- Add all the odd numbers from 11 through 21
total = 0
for value in np.arange(11, 21):
    total = total + value
print(total)
```

```{python}
#- Print all the numbers starting from 100, and subtracting 7
#- up to the last positive number.  The first three
#- numbers you will print will be 100, 93, 86
for i in np.arange(100, 7, 7):
    print(i)
```

```{python}
#- Add every third number in the inclusive range 1 through 21
total = 0
for i in np.arange(1, 21):
    total = total + 1
print(total)
```
