This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

You know the drill now, but you can add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert
Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

We first read the dataset containing information about the passengers (not
crew) who were on the RMS Titanic when it sank.

See the [Vanderbuilt biostatistics
datasets](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets) for more
detail on this dataset.

You might also want to look at [Encylopedia
Titanica](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-statistics.html) for
more background.

```{r}
# Read the dataset directly from the URL.  After this, the variable "titanic"
# is a data frame.
titanic <- read.csv("http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv",
             stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Notice the option  `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.  This prevents R from assuming
that any columns that contain character strings, are factors.  For example,
you'll see soon that the passengers' names are strings, but we don't want to
make that into a factor (there would be one level for each passenger).

Next we convert some of the columns to factors.  Make sure you execute this
chunk so the columns are correctly set as factors.

```{r}
# pclass is the passenger class (1, 2 or 3 for first, second, third).
titanic$pclass <- factor(titanic$pclass)
# sex is a passenger gender ('male' or 'female')
titanic$sex <- factor(titanic$sex)
# survived is whether the passenger survived or not 0 (Lost) or 1 (Saved).
titanic$survived <- factor(titanic$survived)
# We set the level labels for the survived column.
levels(titanic$survived) <- c('Lost', 'Saved')
# embarked is the port at which the passenger came onto the ship.
titanic$embarked <- factor(titanic$embarked, exclude=c(""))
levels(titanic$embarked) <- c('Cherbourg', 'Queenstown', 'Southampton')
```

Show the names of the columns in the data frame:

```{r}
names(titanic)
```

You might want to inspect the data frame as a spreadsheet using RStudio.  To do
this, run the command `View(titanic)`.  See the note at the end about putting
the `View` command in a chunk in your notebook, rather than running at the R
console.

Show the number of rows (passengers) and columns (variables), using the `dim`
command:

```{r}
#- Use "dim" to show the number of rows and columns of the "titanic" data frame.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 5 so far).
```

Confirm that the `embarked` column of the data frame is in fact a factor, by
showing the levels of that column:

```{r}
#- Show the levels of the "embarked" column of the data frame.
#- If you get NULL here, make sure you've run the cell above that makes the factors.
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 15 so far).
```

Show the first 6 passengers (rows) in the data frame using the `head` function:

```{r}
#- Show the top 6 passengers with the "head" function.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 20 so far).
```

As you get older, you get richer (at least, that's how it seems to us, your
instructors).  So, are first class passengers generally older than third class
passengers?

Do a box plot of the ages of the passengers as a function of class.  Have a
look to see if the first class passengers tend to be older.

Hint - make sure you've got all three passenger classes on your x axis.  You'll
probably need the `~` syntax that you saw in the tutorial.  Remember, you can
read the `~` operator as "as a function of".

```{r}
#- Do a box plot of the distribution of ages as a function of passenger class.
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 30 so far).
```

I am sure we all believe that female passengers were more likely to be put onto
the lifeboats. Now we will check if that's really true.

Use the `table` function to show the counts of male and female passengers
overall.  If you can't remember the column names, have a look at the result of
the `names(titanic)` chunk above, or the column names in the View tab.

```{r}
#- Use "table" to show the counts of male and female passengers.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 35 so far).
```

Now use the `survived` column to give a table with a breakdown of how many male
and female passengers survived.  Show the table.  Check the tutorial for how to
break down counts by more than one column.

```{r}
#- Make a new table called "mf_survived" with the numbers of men and women who
#- survived.  Show the table.
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 45 so far).
```

Show these counts graphically as proportions using `mosaicplot`. Check the help
on `mosaicplot` for the input you need.  See whether you agree that women were
more likely to be saved than men.

```{r}
#- Make a graphical plot of the table of male / female survival numbers with
#- "mosaicplot".
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 50 so far).
```

We also have a strong suspicion that the first class passengers had a better
chance of being saved than the second or third class passengers.  Let's check
if that is true.

First make a table breaking down the counts in each passenger class by whether
they survived.  Show that table in the notebook.

```{r}
#- Make a new table called "pclass_survived" with the numbers of first, second,
#- third class passengers who survived.  Show the table.
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 60 so far).
```

Show the proportions who survived by passenger class graphically using
`mosaicplot`.

```{r}
#- Show the table of survival numbers graphically with "mosaicplot"
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 65 so far).
```

We also think that children had a better chance of being saved.  We guess that
children in first class are a bit more likely to be saved than children in
third class.  To look at this we first use the `subset` command to make a new
data frame that only includes the passengers with ages less than 15.  Check
back at the tutorial for how to select a subset of a data frame according to a
condition like "age less than 15".  Show the first 6 cases of this new data
frame to check you do in fact have the passengers younger than 15.

```{r}
#- Make a new data frame called "children" containing only the passengers
#- younger than 15.  Use the subset command.  Then, use "head" to check that you
#- have passengers younger than 15.
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 75 so far).
```

Use your new `children` data frame to make a table breaking down the counts of
children in the different passenger classes, by whether or not they survived.
Show the table.

```{r}
#- Use the "children" data frame to make a table called "pclass_children"
#- giving counts of children for each passenger class, broken down by whether
#- or not they survived.  Show the table.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 80 so far).
```

Show the `pclass_children` table you've just made with `mosaicplot`.  Are
higher-class children more likely to survive?

```{r}
#- Use "mosaicplot" to show the proportions of children of each class who survived.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 85 so far).
```

Finally, we might wonder if the crew of the Titanic were national chauvinists.
Did they, for example, prefer to save the passengers from good old Southampton,
over those from Ireland (Queenstown) or France (Cherbourg)?  The passengers'
survival also depend on where they embarked?

We already know that the chances of being saved were better if you were a
female, and in the higher ticket classes.  To control for that, let us first
select the women in third class.  Use the `subset` function to select the
passengers that are `third` class AND `female`.  Refer back to the tutorial for
how to combine conditions like this using the subset function.

```{r}
#- Use "subset" to make a new data frame "third_class_female" that contains all
#- the passengers that are both female and in third class.  Show the first 6
#- rows of this new data frame.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 90 so far).
```

Make a table that breaks down counts of new `third_class_female` data frame by
where they embarked, and whether they survived. Show this table.

```{r}
#- Use the "third_class_female" data frame to make a table called
#- "port_by_saved" giving counts of third class female passengers for each port
#- they embarked, broken down by whether or not they survived.  Show the table.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 95 so far).
```

Show the proportions in this table with "mosaicplot".  Did the crew prefer to
save English women?

```{r}
#- Show the new "port_by_saved" table with a mosaicplot
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 100 so far).
```

That's it.  Before you submit:

* Remember that you should submit the `.Rmd` file, not the `.nb.html` file, nor
  any of the other files that the R notebook makes.  Make sure your notebook
  file does have the extension `.Rmd`.
* Before you submit this notebook for marking, make sure that all the chunks
  execute correctly.  To do that, go to the Run button at the top of the
  notebook, and click "Restart R and Clear Output".  Then go to the top of the
  notebook, and run each chunk in turn, to make sure that they run without
  error, and give you the output you expect.  *Remember, we're going to run an
  automated marking script over this file, so it has to execute correctly, for
  you to get the marks*.   You can make your life a bit easier by making sure
  that you don't have any `View` commands in your notebook chunks.   If you
  don't have any of these, you can go to the Run button and choose "Restart R
  and run all chunks" - this will run the whole notebook.   Then you can check
  the output is OK in the notebook, and submit.  If you do have `View`
  commands, this doesn't work because the notebook execution blocks as it does
  the `View`.  In that case, you have to run each chunk one by one.
