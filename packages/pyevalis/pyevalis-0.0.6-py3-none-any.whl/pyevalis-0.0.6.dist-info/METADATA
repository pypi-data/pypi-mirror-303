# PyEvalis

## Overview

PyEvalis is a Python library for building and evaluating machine learning models, specifically focusing on Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms. It aims to simplify the process of model training and evaluation, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced data scientists.

## Features

- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method for classification and regression that builds multiple decision trees and merges their outputs for improved accuracy.
- **Decision Tree**: A straightforward model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences, ideal for both classification and regression tasks.

## Installation

You can install My Package using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pyevalis
