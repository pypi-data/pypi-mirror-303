*A probability distribution is:*

a mathematical description

::: {.fragment}
of a random phenomenon
:::

::: {.fragment}
in terms of all its possible outcomes
:::

::: {.fragment}
and their associated probabilities

In this image, what do you expect to be:

- all the possible outcomes?
- the associated probabilities?

## Distributions: types
The main types of distributions are:

- **Discrete** : when an outcome can only take discrete values (e.g. number of birds)
- **Continuous** : when outcomes take continuous values (e.g. blood pressure)

Every horizontal line you draw can be interpreted as a continuous distribution.
Every barplot as a discrete distribution.

**All** the distributions we are going to discuss are variations of these two basic types!

For *parametric distributions*, we have a formula that describes the line / bars.
You just put in the parameters, and the output is the line / bars.

## Discrete distributions: PMF

A **probability mass function** (pmf) describes the probability distribution of discrete variables.

Consider a toin coss:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
  0.5  & x \text{ is head} \\
  0.5 & x \text{ is tails}
\end{cases}
$$

This is the pmf of the *Bernoulli distribution*

## Conditions for a PMF

::: {.fragment}
1. An event cannot have a negative probability
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. The sum of probabilities of all events must be 1
:::

::: {.fragment}
3. The probability of a subset $X$ of outcomes $T$ is the same as adding the probabilities of the individual elements.
:::

## Conditions for a pmf{.smaller}
### Mathematical description
The probability is a function $f$ over the sample space $\mathscr{S}$ of a discrete random variable $X$, which gives the probability that $X$ is equal to a certain value.
$$f(x) = P(X = x)$$

Each pmf satisfies these conditions:
$$
\begin{align}
f(x) \geq 0 ,\, \forall x \in X\\
\Sigma_{x \in \mathscr{S}} \, f(x) = 1
\end{align}
$$

for a collection $\mathscr{A}$
$$P(\mathscr{A} \in \mathscr{S}) =\Sigma_{x_i \in \mathscr{A}} f(x_i)$$

## Continuous distributions: PDF

For continuous distributions, we use a probability density function (pdf).

::: {.fragment}
1. $f(x) > 0 ,\, \forall x \in X$
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. The integral of the probabilities of all possible events must be 1 (area under the curve)
:::

::: {.fragment}
3. The probability $X$ of values in the interval $[a,b]$ is the integral from $a$ to $b$
:::

## Continuous distributions: Conditions for a PDF

This might look like unnecessary mathematical details.
But it is actually important to understand the difference.

Example: can you answer the question "What is the probability your body temperature is 37.0 C?"

::: {.fragment}
The answer might be unexpected: 0!
:::


::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
Let's say your answer is 25%. But what if your temperature is 37.1? does that count?
Or 37.01?
:::

::: {.fragment}
Because the distribution is *continuous* you can only say something about the *range*
"What is the probability your temperature is between 36.5 and 37.2 C?"

## Normal Distribution: Central Limit Theorem {.smaller}

::: {.column width="50%"}
This is one of the distributions that is used most often.

A major reason for this is, that if you keep sampling and **adding** from a population you
*always* end up with a normal distribution.

Take a persons height.

- This is determined by a combination of 180 genes.
- One gene will contribute to a longer neck, the other to longer legs
- If we assume the genes contribute independently, height equals the sum of 180 genes.

Thus, height will be normally distributed.
So will the weight of wolves or the length of a penguins wing.

However, **multiplying** values will give you a long tail!

This is the case when variables interact in some way, and are not independent.

$$4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16$$

but

$$4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256$$

but

$$4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256$$

This is common if variables interact with each other. Examples are stock prices, failures of machines, ping times on a network, income distribution.

**multiplying** values will give you a fat-tail distribution!
This will typically be a log-normal distribution:

if $X$ is log-normal distibuted, then $Y = log(X)$ will be a normal distribution.

Now I tell you that the $x$ axis is the amount of hours invested in study,
and the $y$ axis is the average grade of a student.
