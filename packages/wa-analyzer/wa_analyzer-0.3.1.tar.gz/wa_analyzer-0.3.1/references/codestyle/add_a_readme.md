If you go beyond just testing a concept for yourself, and you start to share your code with your colleagues, other students, or teacher, you need to add a README file. 

This file will contain information about the project, how to run the code, and what the code does. This will help the other person to understand your code and to be able to run it.

Cover things like:
1. üìù Project Title and Description
- What is the project about?
- What problem does it solve?

2. üß∞ Instructions
- How to install any necessary dependencies
- List of additional frameworks or tools required (not covered by the pyproject.toml file)
- Step-by-step guide to set up the project
PS: you dont have to write instructions for every OS; for the course, at a minimum cover UNIX systems (mac or linux). You could add instructions for Windows, but no sane person develops code on Windows anyway :)

3. üí™ Usage
- List of key features or functionalities
- How can the user run the code?
- What are diffent options while running the code?
- Examples of how to use the project or its main functions

4. üõû Configuration
- Any configuration settings or environment variables needed

5. ‚ùì Optional
- add emojis to make it more colorful. You can simply copy your README into a LLM and ask it to add emojis to your project (or even to write parts of it based on your code).
- A brief overview of the project's file/folder organization
- Guidelines for how others can contribute to the project
- Instructions on how to run tests, if applicable
- Any bugs or known limitations users should be aware of
- Upcoming features or improvements
- Information about the project's license
- How to reach the project maintainer(s)
- Credits to any resources, libraries, or individuals that helped with the project


Including these elements in your README file will provide a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to understand, use, or contribute to your project. Remember to keep the information clear, concise, and well-organized.
