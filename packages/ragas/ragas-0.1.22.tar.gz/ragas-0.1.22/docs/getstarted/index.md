Welcome to the Ragas tutorials! If you're new to Ragas, the Get Started guides will walk you through the fundamentals of working with Ragas. These tutorials assume basic knowledge of Python and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. 

Before you proceed further, ensure that you have [Ragas installed](./install.md)!

:::{note}
The tutorials only provide an overview of what you can accomplish with Ragas and the basic skills needed to utilize it effectively. For an in-depth explanation of the core concepts behind Ragas, check out the [Core Concepts](../concepts/index.md) page. You can also explore the [How-to Guides](../howtos/index.md) for specific applications of Ragas.
