    api_key="API-XXXXXXXX"  # Your API key
)
```

### 3. Preauthorize a Payment

### 4. Commit the Preauthorization

```python
response = client.preauthorize(
    payer_account="61XXXXXXXX", 
    amount="0.01",
    )

response_code = response['responseCode']
if response_code == '2001':
    transaction_id = response['transactionId']
    client.commit(transaction_id=transaction_id)
else:
    errorMessage = response['responseMsg']
    print(errorMessage)
```

### 5. Cancel the Preauthorization
