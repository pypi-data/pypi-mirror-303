KahootPy is a Python client for interacting with the Kahoot API, allowing you to join games, send responses, and handle events in real-time.

## 🌟 Features
- **Join Games**: Quickly join Kahoot games using game PINs.
- **Event Handling**: Register handlers for various game events such as questions and game status updates.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilize WebSocket connections for real-time interaction with the Kahoot server.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface for sending packets and handling game events.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Install the package via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install kahoot
   ```

2. Import and use KahootPy in your Python script:
   ```python
   from kahoot import KahootClient
   ```

## 🛠️ Example Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the KahootClient:
**Info**: Check [client_example.py](https://github.com/vehbiu/kahoot-py/blob/main/client_example.py) for an example that correctly utilizes the API

```python
import asyncio
from kahoot import KahootClient
from kahoot.packets.server.question_start import QuestionStartPacket

async def question_start(packet: QuestionStartPacket):
    print(f"Question started: {packet}")

async def main():
    client = KahootClient()
    client.on("question_start", question_start)
    await client.join_game(game_pin=3850352, username='your_username')

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### 🎉 Event Handlers
- **Joining a Game**: Use the `join_game` method to join a game with a specific PIN and username.
- **Listening for Events**: Register handlers for various events (e.g., questions, game status) using the `on` method.

## ⚙️ Technical Details
- Built using `httpx` for HTTP requests and `aiocometd` for WebSocket communication.
- Utilizes asynchronous programming with Python's `asyncio` for efficient real-time interaction.
- Modular design with separate packet handling and utility functions for easy maintenance.
