This gets you a ASGI app, with a production static files server
(`WhiteNoise <http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/>`_)
pre-installed, jinja2 templating (without additional imports), and a
production webserver based on uvloop, serving up requests with
automatic gzip compression.

Features
--------

- A pleasant API, with a single import statement.
- Class-based views without inheritance.
- `ASGI <https://asgi.readthedocs.io>`_ framework, the future of Python web services.
- WebSocket support!
- The ability to mount any ASGI / WSGI app at a subroute.
- `f-string syntax <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-498-formatted-string-literals>`_ route declaration.
- Mutable response object, passed into each view. No need to return anything.
- Background tasks, spawned off in a ``ThreadPoolExecutor``.
- GraphQL (with *GraphiQL*) support!
- OpenAPI schema generation, with interactive documentation!
- Single-page webapp support!

Installing dyne
--------------------

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install dyne

Only **Python 3.8+** and above is supported.


The Basic Idea
--------------

The primary concept here is to bring the niceties that are brought forth from both Flask and Falcon and unify them into a single framework, along with some new ideas I have. I also wanted to take some of the API primitives that are instilled in the Requests library and put them into a web framework. So, you'll find a lot of parallels here with Requests.

- Setting ``resp.content`` sends back bytes.
- Setting ``resp.text`` sends back unicode, while setting ``resp.html`` sends back HTML.
- Setting ``resp.media`` sends back JSON/YAML (``.text``/``.html``/``.content`` override this).
- Case-insensitive ``req.headers`` dict (from Requests directly).
- ``resp.status_code``, ``req.method``, ``req.url``, and other familiar friends.

Ideas
-----

- Flask-style route expression, with new capabilities -- all while using Python 3.6+'s new f-string syntax.
- I love Falcon's "every request and response is passed into each view and mutated" methodology, especially ``response.media``, and have used it here. In addition to supporting JSON, I have decided to support YAML as well, as Kubernetes is slowly taking over the world, and it uses YAML for all the things. Content-negotiation and all that.
- **A built in testing client that uses the actual Requests you know and love**.
- The ability to mount other WSGI apps easily.
- Automatic gzipped-responses.
- In addition to Falcon's ``on_get``, ``on_post``, etc methods, dyne features an ``on_request`` method, which gets called on every type of request, much like Requests.
- A production static files server is built-in.
- `Uvicorn <https://www.uvicorn.org/>`_ is built-in as a production web server. I would have chosen Gunicorn, but it doesn't run on Windows. Plus, Uvicorn serves well to protect against `slowloris <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security)>`_ attacks, making nginx unnecessary in production.
- GraphQL support, via Graphene. The goal here is to have any GraphQL query exposable at any route, magically.
