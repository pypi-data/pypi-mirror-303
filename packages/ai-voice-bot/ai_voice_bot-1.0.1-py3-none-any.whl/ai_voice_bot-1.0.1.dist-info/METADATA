# AI Voice Bot

This project is an AI-powered voice bot built using OpenAI's Realtime API. It allows for real-time voice interaction through a command-line interface (CLI) and can be modified to handle text output, as well as include a mocked version for cost-effective testing.

## Project Structure

- `ai_voice_bot/`: Contains the main implementation of the voice bot.

- `misc/`: Directory for miscellaneous files.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files should be ignored by Git.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file.
- `README.md`: The README file that you're reading right now.
- `install.bat`: A batch script for setting up the environment.
- `mock_bot.py`: A mock version of the bot for testing without using the API.
- `push.bat`: A batch script for pushing changes to GitHub.
- `setup.py`: The setup script for packaging and distributing the project.
- `text_bot.py`: The script for handling text-based output from the bot.
- `voice_bot.py`: The script for handling voice-based interaction.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: The bot supports real-time voice input and can generate real-time responses using OpenAI's Realtime API.
- **Text-Based Interaction**: You can modify the bot to handle text input and output instead of voice, allowing for more versatile use cases.
- **Mock Bot**: The mock bot allows for testing and development without incurring costs from the API.
