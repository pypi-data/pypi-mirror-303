
# AI Voice Bot

This project is an AI-powered voice bot built using OpenAI's Realtime API. It allows for real-time voice interaction through a command-line interface (CLI) and can be modified to handle text output, as well as include a mocked version for cost-effective testing.

## Project Structure

- `ai_voice_bot/`: Contains the main implementation of the voice bot.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: The bot supports real-time voice input and can generate real-time responses using OpenAI's Realtime API.
- **Text-Based Interaction**: You can modify the bot to handle text input and output instead of voice, allowing for more versatile use cases.
- **Mock Bot**: The mock bot allows for testing and development without incurring costs from the API.
