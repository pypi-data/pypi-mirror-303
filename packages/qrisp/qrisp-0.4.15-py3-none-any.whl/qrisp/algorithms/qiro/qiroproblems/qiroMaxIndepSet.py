    Creates a replacement routine for the problem structure, i.e., defines the replacement rules.

    exclusions : list
        Qubits which were found to be negatively correlated, i.e., not part of the problem solution, or contradict solution qubits in accordance with the update rules.

def create_max_indep_cost_operator_reduced(graph, solutions=[]):
    r"""
    Creates the ``cost_operator`` for the problem instance.
    This operator is adjusted to consider qubits that were found to be a part of the problem solution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.Graph
        The graph for the problem instance.
    solutions : list
