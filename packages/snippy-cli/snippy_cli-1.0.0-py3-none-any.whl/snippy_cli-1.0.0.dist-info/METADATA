It's designed to help developers quickly store and retrieve useful code snippets, all while keeping things simple and straightforward.

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 **Create, list, and manage snippets** easily.
- ✏️ **Open snippets** in your preferred text editor.
- 📋 **Copy snippets** directly to the clipboard.
- 🗑️ **Delete snippets** when they are no longer needed.
