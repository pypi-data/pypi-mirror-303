Run spotMAX as a Python package
===============================

You can run spotMAX as a Python package by using the **high-level functions** 
available in the ``pipe`` module. 

See this section for more details about the available functions :ref:`api`. 

Feel free to explore also the functions from the other modules, however, 
documentation for those modules is still work in progress :(. If you need help 
with those, submit an issue on our `GitHub page`_ specifying which 
functions you would like to use.

As a regular Python package you can also use spotMAX in a **Jupyter notebook**. 

You can find `example notebooks`_ on our GitHub page.
