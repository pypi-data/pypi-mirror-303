# Cryptizia

Cryptizia is a Python library for various cipher techniques including the Caesar cipher. 

## Installation

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install cryptizia

```
## How to use in Code

### Caeser Cipher

```python

from cryptizia import CaesarCipherExample

CaesarCipherExample()
```
### Customization
You can customize the 'shift' and 'plaintext' directly in the constructor if you want different values:
```python
# Example with custom shift and plaintext
cipher = CaesarCipherExample(shift=5, plaintext="WORLD")
```
You can encrypt and decrypt whole file using Caeser Cipher class
```python

from CaeserCipher import CaesarCipher

# Example usage with a file
def encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, shift):
    cipher = CaesarCipher()
    
    # Read the content of the input file
    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
        file_content = file.read()
    
    # Encrypt the content
    encrypted_content = cipher.caesar_encrypt(file_content, shift)
    
    # Write the encrypted content to the output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        file.write(encrypted_content)

def decrypt_file(input_file, output_file, shift):
    cipher = CaesarCipher()
    
    # Read the content of the input file
    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
        file_content = file.read()
    
    # Decrypt the content
    decrypted_content = cipher.caesar_decrypt(file_content, shift)
    
    # Write the decrypted content to the output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        file.write(decrypted_content)

# Example: Encrypting and decrypting a file
encrypt_file('example.txt', 'encrypted.txt', 3)  # Encrypt 'example.txt' with a shift of 3 and save it as 'encrypted.txt'
decrypt_file('encrypted.txt', 'decrypted.txt', 3)  # Decrypt 'encrypted.txt' with a shift of 3 and save it as 'decrypted.txt'
```

### Playfair Cipher

```python

from cryptizia import PlayfairCipherExample

PlayfairCipherExample()
```
