============
TAP-Producer
============

Producer for Test Anything Protocol output in Python.
Automatically counts test points at call time for TAP version 12, 13, and 14.

.. code-block::

   from tap_producer import TAP
   with TAP() as t:
     t.ok('passed')
     t.ok('also passed')

TAP version 12 supports plan, ok, not ok, diagnostic comment, and bail out
functionality.

.. code-block::

   from tap_producer import TAP
   with TAP() as t:
      t.ok('passed').comment('debug information')
      if FAIL_CONDITION:
         t.not_ok('did not pass')
         t.bail_out()

TAP version 13 supports the aforementioned as well as subtest context manager
and YAML diagnostic output.

.. code-block::

   with TAP.subtest('subtest') as st:
      st.plan(count=1, skip_count=0).ok('ok', {'yaml-key': 'yaml-val'})

TAP-Producer also includes two decorators, a suppress context manager for
suppressing TAP output and a strict context manager for raising not ok test
cases to Python errors.

.. code-block::

   from tap_producer import TAP
   with TAP() as t:
      with t.suppress():
         t.ok('passed but suppressed')
      with t.strict()
         t.not_ok('this is now a Python exception')
