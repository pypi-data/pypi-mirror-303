ATorch supports efficient and easy-to-use model training experience. ATorch provides performance optimizations in aspects such as I/O, preprocessing, computation, and communication (including automatic optimization), and has supported large-scale pretraining and finetuning of LLMs with over 100 billion parameters and thousands of advanced GPUs.
