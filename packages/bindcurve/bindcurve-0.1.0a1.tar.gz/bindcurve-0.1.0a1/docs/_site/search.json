    "text": "Model - Direct Binding, Specific + Nonspecific\nNonspecific binding (immobilization) of the labeled ligand \\(L^*\\) can be modeled by introducing a dimensionless, non-negative parameter \\(N^*\\). In this case, the dissociation constant \\(K_d^*\\) is defined in the same way as above: \\[\nK_d^* = \\frac{[R][L^*]}{[RL^*]}\n\\]\nNow, the conservation of mass requires that: \\[\n[L^* ]_T = [L^*] + [RL^*] + N^*[L^*]\n\\] \\[\n[R]_T = [R] + [RL^*]\n\\]\nThus, \\([RL^*]\\) is calculated as: \\[\n[RL^*] = \\frac{[R][L^*]_T}{K_d^*(1+N^*) + [R]}\n\\]\nAgain, \\([R]\\) can be expressed in a quadratic equation: \\[\n[R]^2 + a[R] + b = 0\n\\]\nwhere the coefficients are calculated as: \\[\na = K_d^*(1+N^*) + [L^*]_T - [R]_T\n\\] \\[\nb = -K_d^*[R]_T(1+N^*)\n\\]\nThe physical solution for \\([R]\\) is again calculated using the quadratic formula: \\[\n[R] = \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}\n\\]\nClearly, the introduction of \\(N^*\\) leads to a model where the dissociation constant \\(K_d^*\\) is scaled by a factor of \\((1+N^*)\\). Thus, the total binding is modeled as specific binding defined by \\(K_d^*\\) and a nonspecific binding scaling term depending on \\(N^*\\). For example, if we consider \\(N^* = 0.5\\), the resulting effective dissociation constant for total binding in this model would be \\(1.5K_d^*\\) (total binding would be 150% of the specific binding). Finally, if \\(N^* = 0\\) (there is no nonspecific binding), the model collapses to the case for specific binding only.\n\nComplete competitive binding (three-state models)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn three-state models, the system is composed of receptor \\(R\\), labeled ligand \\(L^*\\), and unlabeled ligand \\(L\\). The formation of complex \\(RL^*\\) is described by a dissociation constant \\(K_d^*\\), while the formation of complex \\(RL\\) is described by a dissociation constant \\(K_d\\). For such a system, \\(F_b^*\\) could be related to the concentration of free receptor \\([R]\\) by the equation\n\\[\nF_b^* = \\frac{[RL^*]}{[L^*]_T} = \\frac{[R]}{K_d + [R]}\n\\]\nTo allow for a proper description of the dependent variable, the general framework for competitive binding is defined as\n\\[\ny = ymin + (ymax - ymin) \\frac{[R]}{K_d + [R]}\n\\]\nThe theory for the competitive binding models is based on:\n\nWang, 1995\nRoehrl, 2004",

In all models, you can fix both the ymin and/or ymax parameters which will constrain the lower and/or upper asymptote of the model.

This binding equilibrium is described by a dissociation constant \\(K_d^*\\). For such a system, \\(F_b^*\\) could be related to the concentration of free receptor \\([R]\\) by the equation\n\\[\nF_b^* = \\frac{[RL^*]}{[L^*]_T} = \\frac{[R]}{K_d^* + [R]}\n\\]\nTo allow for a proper description of the dependent variable, the general framework for direct binding is defined as\n\\[\ny = ymin + (ymax - ymin) \\frac{[R]}{K_d^* + [R]}\n\\]\n\nDirect binding - simplified\nModel name: dir_simple\nIn this simplified model, the concentration of the free receptor \\([R]\\) is approximated by the total concentration of the receptor \\([R]_T\\). Thus, \\([R]\\) is simply given as: \\[\n[R] = [R]_T\n\\]\n\n\nDirect binding - specific\nModel name: dir_specific\nTo properly describe direct binding beyond the simplified approximation above, let us look at an exact model. The dissociation constant \\(K_d^*\\) is defined as: \\[\nK_d^* = \\frac{[R][L^*]}{[RL^*]}\n\\]\nConservation of mass requires that: \\[\n[L^* ]_T = [L^*] + [RL^*]\n\\] \\[\n[R]_T = [R] + [RL^*]\n\\]\nwhere \\([R]_T\\) is the total concentration of the receptor and \\([L^*]\\) is the concentration of free labeled ligand. Thus, \\([RL^*]\\) is calculated as: \\[\n[RL^*] = \\frac{[R] [L^* ]_T}{K_d^* + [R]}\n\\]\nFrom the equations above, \\([R]\\) can be expressed in a quadratic equation: \\[\n[R]^2 + a[R] + b = 0\n\\]\nwhere the coefficients are calculated as: \\[\na = K_d^* + [L^*]_T - [R]_T\n\\] \\[\nb = -K_d^* [R]_T\n\\]\nThe physical solution for \\([R]\\) is calculated as the positive root using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\n[R] = \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\nDirect binding - total\nModel name: dir_total\nNonspecific binding (immobilization) of the labeled ligand \\(L^*\\) can be modeled by introducing a dimensionless, non-negative parameter \\(N^*\\). In this case, the dissociation constant \\(K_d^*\\) is defined in the same way as above: \\[\nK_d^* = \\frac{[R][L^*]}{[RL^*]}\n\\]\nNow, the conservation of mass requires that: \\[\n[L^* ]_T = [L^*] + [RL^*] + N^*[L^*]\n\\] \\[\n[R]_T = [R] + [RL^*]\n\\]\nThus, \\([RL^*]\\) is calculated as: \\[\n[RL^*] = \\frac{[R][L^*]_T}{K_d^*(1+N^*) + [R]}\n\\]\nAgain, \\([R]\\) can be expressed in a quadratic equation: \\[\n[R]^2 + a[R] + b = 0\n\\]\nwhere the coefficients are calculated as: \\[\na = K_d^*(1+N^*) + [L^*]_T - [R]_T\n\\] \\[\nb = -K_d^*[R]_T(1+N^*)\n\\]\nThe physical solution for \\([R]\\) is again calculated using the quadratic formula: \\[\n[R] = \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}\n\\]\nClearly, the introduction of \\(N^*\\) leads to a model where the dissociation constant \\(K_d^*\\) is scaled by a factor of \\((1+N^*)\\). Thus, the total binding is modeled as specific binding defined by \\(K_d^*\\) and a nonspecific binding scaling term depending on \\(N^*\\). For example, if we consider \\(N^* = 0.5\\), the resulting effective dissociation constant for total binding in this model would be \\(1.5K_d^*\\) (total binding would be 150% of the specific binding). Finally, if \\(N^* = 0\\) (there is no nonspecific binding), the model collapses to the case for specific binding only.",

Thus, \\([RL^*]\\) is calculated as: \\[\n[RL^*] = \\frac{[R] [L^* ]_T}{K_d^* + [R]}\n\\]\nFrom the equations above, \\([R]\\) can be expressed in a quadratic equation: \\[\n[R]^2 + a[R] + b = 0\n\\]\nwhere the coefficients are calculated as: \\[\na = K_d^* + [L^*]_T - [R]_T\n\\] \\[\nb = -K_d^* [R]_T\n\\]\nThe physical solution for \\([R]\\) is calculated as the positive root using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\n[R] = \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\nDirect binding - total\nModel name: dir_total\nNonspecific binding (immobilization) of the labeled ligand \\(L^*\\) can be modeled by introducing a dimensionless, non-negative parameter \\(N^*\\). In this case, the dissociation constant \\(K_d^*\\) is defined in the same way as above: \\[\nK_d^* = \\frac{[R][L^*]}{[RL^*]}\n\\]\nNow, the conservation of mass requires that: \\[\n[L^* ]_T = [L^*] + [RL^*] + N^*[L^*]\n\\] \\[\n[R]_T = [R] + [RL^*]\n\\]\nThus, \\([RL^*]\\) is calculated as: \\[\n[RL^*] = \\frac{[R][L^*]_T}{K_d^*(1+N^*) + [R]}\n\\]\nAgain, \\([R]\\) can be expressed in a quadratic equation: \\[\n[R]^2 + a[R] + b = 0\n\\]\nwhere the coefficients are calculated as: \\[\na = K_d^*(1+N^*) + [L^*]_T - [R]_T\n\\] \\[\nb = -K_d^*[R]_T(1+N^*)\n\\]\nThe physical solution for \\([R]\\) is again calculated using the quadratic formula: \\[\n[R] = \\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}\n\\]\nClearly, the introduction of \\(N^*\\) leads to a model where the dissociation constant \\(K_d^*\\) is scaled by a factor of \\((1+N^*)\\). Thus, the total binding is modeled as specific binding defined by \\(K_d^*\\) and a nonspecific binding scaling term depending on \\(N^*\\). For example, if we consider \\(N^* = 0.5\\), the resulting effective dissociation constant for total binding in this model would be \\(1.5K_d^*\\) (total binding would be 150% of the specific binding). Finally, if \\(N^* = 0\\) (there is no nonspecific binding), the model collapses to the case for specific binding only.",
