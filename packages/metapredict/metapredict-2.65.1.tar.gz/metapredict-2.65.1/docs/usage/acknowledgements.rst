=================

PARROT, created by Dan Griffith, was used to generate the network used for metapredict. See https://pypi.org/project/idptools-parrot/ for some very cool machine learning stuff from Dan.

In addition to using Dan Griffith's tool for creating metapredict, the code for ``brnn_architecture.py`` and ``encode_sequence.py`` was written by Dan (originally for PARROT). 

We would also like to thank the team at MobiDB for creating the database that was used to train this predictor. Check out their awesome stuff at https://mobidb.bio.unipd.it

We would like to thank the **DeepMind** team for developing AlphaFold and EBI/UniProt for making these data so readily available.
