Backend of the ORIGINAL IDR machine learning predictor. Based partly
on code from Dan Griffith's IDP-Parrot from the Holehouse lab
(specifically the test_unlabeled_data function in train_network.py).

This also contains the code for metapredict-hybrid (function is
meta_predict_hybrid()), which was used to generate scores that were used 
to train the newest metapredict network, metameta_2_7_22_nl2_hs20_b32_v3.pt.

Yes, metapredict somehow got a little bit more meta.
