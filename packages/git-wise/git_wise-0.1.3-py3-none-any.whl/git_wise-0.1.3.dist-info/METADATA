## Welcome to Git-Wise

Welcome to Git-Wise, a project born from the realization that my commit skills weren't quite up to par while developing another product! 😎 After about 10 hours of development, we now have this version.

Git-Wise uses GPT to analyze your staged files, automatically generate commit messages, and submit them! It's designed to enhance your Git workflow and improve the quality of your commit history.

As the project is still in the development stage, there may be some issues. However, if you encounter any problems or have ideas for improvement, please feel free to reach out and contribute your code!

> Fun fact: Every commit in this repository was crafted with the help of Git-Wise!🫡
