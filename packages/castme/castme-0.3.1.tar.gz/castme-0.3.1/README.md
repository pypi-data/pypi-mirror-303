# CastMe

CastMe is a simple Python REPL that allows you to cast music from a Subsonic server to a Chromecast device, or to the local device.

**NOTE: The subsonic server must expose a URL over HTTPS. And since the chromecast will be the one connecting to the server, the certificate need to be trusted. This project is tested against [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) only.**

### Installation (pip / pipx / ...)

`castme` is available directly in [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/castme/):
```
pip install castme
```

Just create the configuration file using `--init` and edit the content:

```
> castme --init
Configuration initialized in /home/blizarre/.config/castme.toml, please edit it before starting castme again
```

Castme will automatically look for the `castme.toml` file in `/etc` or in the current directory as well. use `--config` in conjunction with `--init` to set the location of the configuration file.

### Usage

Run the script, and enter the commands in the REPL. For instance:
- List the available Albums
```bash
$ castme

```
