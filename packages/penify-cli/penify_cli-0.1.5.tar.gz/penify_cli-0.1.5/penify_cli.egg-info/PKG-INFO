# Penify CLI

Penify CLI is a command-line tool for managing Git hooks, generating documentation, and streamlining the development workflow. It provides functionality to install and uninstall Git post-commit hooks, generate documentation for files or folders, perform Git commits with automated message generation, and manage authentication.

## Installation

You can install Penify CLI using pip:

```bash
pip install penify-cli
```

## Usage

Penify CLI provides several subcommands for different functionalities:

### Login

To log in and obtain an API token:

```bash
penify-cli login
```

This command will open a browser window for authentication. After successful login, the API key will be saved locally for future use.

### Install Git Hook

To install the Git post-commit hook:

```bash
penify-cli install-hook -l /path/to/git/repo
```

- `-l, --location`: The path to the Git repository where you want to install the hook.

### Uninstall Git Hook

To uninstall the Git post-commit hook:

```bash
penify-cli uninstall-hook -l /path/to/git/repo
```

- `-l, --location`: The path to the Git repository from which you want to uninstall the hook.

### Generate Documentation

To generate documentation for files or folders:

```bash
penify-cli doc-gen [options]
```

Options:
- `-fl, --file_path`: Path to a specific file for which to generate documentation.
- `-cf, --complete_folder_path`: Path to a folder for which to generate documentation for all files.
- `-gf, --git_folder_path`: Path to a Git repository to generate documentation for modified files. Defaults to the current directory.

### Commit Code

To commit code with an automatically generated commit message:

```bash
penify-cli commit -gf /path/to/git/repo [-m "Optional message"] [-e True/False]
```

- `-gf, --git_folder_path`: Path to the Git repository. Defaults to the current directory.
- `-m, --message`: Optional commit message. If not provided, a default message will be used.
- `-e, --terminal`: Set to "True" to open the terminal for editing the commit message. Defaults to "False".

## Authentication

Penify CLI uses an API token for authentication. The token is obtained and used in the following priority:

1. Command-line argument: `-t` or `--token`
2. Environment variable: `PENIFY_API_TOKEN`
3. Stored credentials: `~/.penify` file (created after successful login)

If no token is available, you'll be prompted to log in or provide a token.

## Environment Variables

- `PENIFY_API_TOKEN`: You can set this environment variable with your API token to avoid passing it as an argument each time.

## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SingularityX-ai/penify-cli.git
   ```

2. Install the package in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
