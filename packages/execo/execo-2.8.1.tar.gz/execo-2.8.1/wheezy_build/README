Building packages compatible with debian Wheezy and later
*********************************************************

needs vagrant:

$ aptitude install vagrant

simpler with plugin vagrant-vbguest:

$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

or if install complains about conflicting dependencies, you may try:

$ VAGRANT_DISABLE_STRICT_DEPENDENCY_ENFORCEMENT=1 vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

Then:

$ vagrant up

$ ./builddeb <gpg key id>

or

$ ./builddeb UNSIGNED

Debian packages then end-up in the packages/ directory

FIXME: as this dir is rsynced to the vagrant box, the size of the box
will grow as more packages are built
