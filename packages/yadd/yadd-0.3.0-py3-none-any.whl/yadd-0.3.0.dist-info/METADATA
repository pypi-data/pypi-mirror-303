Yet Another `dict` Differ

# Debug aid

`yadd` helps you debug your dict differences. It pinpoints the values that are different to aid in debugging.

# Close enough

You may have heard the term "close enough for Jazz". Well, that can apply to floating point numbers too. yadda uses `cmath.isclose()`
for numbers.

# Lots of data types

- iterables
  - dict
  - list
  - tuple
- numbers
  - int, float, complex, Decimal
- str
- bool

# Make your own yadda-yadda

`yadd` has several parameters, most of which are dependent on the usage model. You may want to consider writing your own
function that calls `yadd` with the parameters most appropriate for your usage.

Example:

```python

from yadd import yadd

def my_yadd(*args, **kwargs) -> bool:
    # loosen up the numeric tolerances
    return yadd(*args, rel_tol=1E-6, abs_tol=1E-9, **kwargs)

```
